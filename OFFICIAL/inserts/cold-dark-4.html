<p> He crossed the bridge over the stream of the Tolka and turned his eyes <b><font color='blue'>coldly</font></b> for an instant towards the faded <b><font color='red'>blue</font></b> shrine of the Blessed Virgin which stood fowl-wise on a pole in the middle of a ham-shaped encampment of poor cottages. Then, bending to the left, he followed the lane which led up to his house. The faint sour stink of rotted cabbages came towards him from the kitchen gardens on the rising ground above the river. He smiled to think that it was this disorder, the misrule and confusion of his father's house and the stagnation of vegetable life, which was to win the day in his soul. Then a short laugh broke from his lips as he thought of that solitary farmhand in the kitchen gardens behind their house whom they had nicknamed the man with the hat.A second laugh, taking rise from the first after a pause, broke from him involuntarily as he thought of how the man with the hat worked, considering in turn the four points of the sky and then regretfully plunging his spade in the earth.</p><hr>

Yet her mistrust pricked him more keenly than his father's pride and he thought <b><font color='blue'>coldly</font></b> how he had watched the faith which was fading down in his soul ageing and strengthening in her eyes.A dim antagonism gathered force within him and <b><font color='red'>darkened</font></b> his mind as a cloud against her disloyalty and when it passed, cloud-like, leaving his mind serene and dutiful towards her again, he was made aware dimly and without regret of a first noiseless sundering of their lives.</p><hr>
<p> He passed from the trembling bridge on to firm land again. At that instant, as it seemed to him, the air was chilled and, looking askance towards the water, he saw a flying squall <b><font color='red'>darkening</font></b> and crisping suddenly the tide.A faint click at his heart, a faint throb in his throat told him once more of how his flesh dreaded the <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> infrahuman odour of the sea; yet he did not strike across the downs on his left but held straight on along the spine of rocks that pointed against the river's mouth.</p><hr>
