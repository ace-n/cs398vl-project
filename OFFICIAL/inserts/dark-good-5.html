<p> The homely version of his christian name on the lips of his friend had touched Stephen pleasantly when first heard for he was as formal in speech with others as they were with him. Often, as he sat in Davin's rooms in Grantham Street, wondering at his friend's <b><font color='red'>well</font></b>-made boots that flanked the wall pair by pair and repeating for his friend's simple ear the verses and cadences of others which were the veils of his own longing and dejection, the rude Firbolg mind of his listener had drawn his mind towards it and flung it back again, drawing it by a quiet inbred courtesy of attention or by a quaint turn of old English speech or by the force of its delight in rude bodily skillâ €” for Davin had sat at the feet of Michael Cusack, the Gaelâ €” repelling swiftly and suddenly by a grossness of intelligence or by a bluntness of feeling or by a dull stare of terror in the eyes, the terror of soul of a starving Irish village in which the curfew was still a <b><font color='blue'>nightly</font></b> fear.</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b>,I suppose that doesn't interest you, but leastways there was such noise after the match thatI missed the train home andI couldn't get any kind of a yoke to give me a lift for, as luck would have it, there was a mass meeting that same day over in Castletownroche and all the cars in the country were there. So there was nothing for it only to stay the <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b> or to foot it out. <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b>,I started to walk and onI went and it was coming on <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b> whenI got into the Ballyhoura hills, that's better than ten miles from Kilmallock and there's a long lonely road after that. You wouldn't see the sign of a christian house along the road or hear a sound. It was pitch <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> almost. Once or twiceI stopped by the way under a bush to redden my pipe and only for the dew was thickI'd have stretched out there and slept. At last, after a bend of the road,I spied a little cottage with a light in the window.I went up and knocked at the door.A voice asked who was there andI answeredI was over at the match in Buttevant and was walking back and thatI'd be thankful for a glass of water. After a while a young woman opened the door and brought me out a big mug of milk. She was half undressed as if she was going to bed whenI knocked and she had her hair hanging andI thought by her figure and by something in the look of her eyes that she must be carrying a child. She kept me in talk a long while at the door, andI thought it strange because her breast and her shoulders were bare. She asked me wasI tired and wouldI like to stop the <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b> there. She said she was all alone in the house and that her husband had gone that morning to Queenstown with his sister to see her off. And all the time she was talking, Stevie, she had her eyes fixed on my face and she stood so close to meI could hear her breathing. WhenI handed her back the mug at last she took my hand to draw me in over the threshold and said:'COME IN AND STAY THE <b><font color='blue'>NIGHT</font></b> HERE. YOU'VE NO CALL TO BE FRIGHTENED. THERE'S NO ONE IN IT BUT OURSELVES ...'I didn't go in, Stevie.I thanked her and went on my way again, all in a fever. At the first bend of the roadI looked back and she was standing at the door.</p><hr>
<p> He came back quickly along the colonnade towards the group of students. <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b> then, let her go and be damned to her! She could love some clean athlete who washed himself every morning to the waist and had <b><font color='blue'>black</font></b> hair on his chest. Let her.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Because, Cranly continued, you need not look upon yourself as driven away if you do not wish to go or as a heretic or an outlaw. There are many <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> believers who think as you do. Would that surprise you? The church is not the stone building nor even the clergy and their dogmas. It is the whole mass of those born into it.I don't know what you wish to do in life. Is it what you told me the <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b> we were standing outside Harcourt Street station?</p><hr>
<p> APRIL3. Met Davin at the cigar shop opposite Findlater's church. He was in a <b><font color='blue'>black</font></b> sweater and had a hurley stick. Asked me was it trueI was going away and why. Told him the shortest way to Tara was VIA Holyhead. Just then my father came up. Introduction. Father polite and observant. Asked Davin if he might offer him some refreshment. Davin could not, was going to a meeting. When we came away father told me he had a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> honest eye. Asked me whyI did not join a rowing club.I pretended to think it over. Told me then how he broke Pennyfeather's heart. Wants me to read law. SaysI was cut out for that. More mud, more crocodiles.</p><hr>
