<p> It would be a gloomy secret <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b>. After early nightfall the yellow lamps would <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> up, here and there, the squalid quarter of the brothels. He would follow a devious course up and down the streets, circling always nearer and nearer in a tremor of fear and joy, until his feet led him suddenly round a <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> corner. The whores would be just coming out of their houses making ready for the <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b>, yawning lazily after their sleep and settling the hairpins in their clusters of hair. He would pass by them calmly waiting for a sudden movement of his own will or a sudden call to his sin-loving soul from their soft perfumed flesh. Yet as he prowled in quest of that call, his senses, stultified only by his desire, would note keenly all that wounded or shamed them; his eyes, a ring of porter froth on a clothless table or a photograph of two soldiers standing to attention or a gaudy playbill; his ears, the drawling jargon of greeting:</p><hr>
<p> The dull <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> fell more <b><font color='red'>faintly</font></b> upon the page whereon another equation began to unfold itself slowly and to spread abroad its widening tail. It was his own soul going forth to experience, unfolding itself sin by sin, spreading abroad the bale-fire of its burning stars and folding back upon itself, fading slowly, quenching its own <b><font color='red'>lights</font></b> and fires. They were quenched: and the cold <b><font color='blue'>darkness</font></b> filled chaos.</p><hr>
<p> As he walked home with silent companions, a thick fog seemed to compass his mind. He waited in stupor of mind till it should lift and reveal what it had hidden. He ate his dinner with surly appetite and when the meal was over and the grease-strewn plates lay abandoned on the table, he rose and went to the window, clearing the thick scum from his mouth with his tongue and licking it from his lips. So he had sunk to the state of a beast that licks his chaps after meat. This was the end; and a <b><font color='red'>faint</font></b> glimmer of fear began to pierce the fog of his mind. He pressed his face against the pane of the window and gazed out into the <b><font color='blue'>darkening</font></b> street. Forms passed this way and that through the dull <b><font color='red'>light</font></b>. And that was life. The letters of the name of Dublin lay heavily upon his mind, pushing one another surlily hither and thither with slow boorish insistence. His soul was fattening and congealing into a gross grease, plunging ever deeper in its dull fear into a sombre threatening dusk while the body that was his stood, listless and dishonoured, gazing out of <b><font color='blue'>darkened</font></b> eyes, helpless, perturbed, and human for a bovine god to stare upon.</p><hr>
<p>O grave, where is thy victory?O death, where is thy sting? Every word of it was for him. Against his sin, foul and secret, the whole wrath of God was aimed. The preacher's knife had probed deeply into his disclosed conscience and he felt now that his soul was festering in sin. Yes, the preacher was right. God's turn had come. Like a beast in its lair his soul had lain down in its own filth but the blasts of the angel's trumpet had driven him forth from the <b><font color='blue'>darkness</font></b> of sin into the <b><font color='red'>light</font></b>. The words of doom cried by the angel shattered in an instant his presumptuous peace. The wind of the last day blew through his mind, his sins, the jewel-eyed harlots of his imagination, fled before the hurricane, squeaking like mice in their terror and huddled under a mane of hair.</p><hr>
<p> As he crossed the square, walking homeward, the <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> laughter of a girl reached his burning ear. The frail gay sound smote his heart more strongly than a trumpet blast, and, not daring to lift his eyes, he turned aside and gazed, as he walked, into the shadow of the tangled shrubs. Shame rose from his smitten heart and flooded his whole being. The image of Emma appeared before him, and under her eyes the flood of shame rushed forth anew from his heart. If she knew to what his mind had subjected her or how his brute-like lust had torn and trampled upon her innocence! Was that boyish love? Was that chivalry? Was that poetry? The sordid details of his orgies stank under his very nostrils. The soot-coated packet of pictures which he had hidden in the flue of the fireplace and in the presence of whose shameless or bashful wantonness he lay for hours sinning in thought and deed; his monstrous dreams, peopled by ape-like creatures and by harlots with gleaming jewel eyes; the foul long letters he had written in the joy of guilty confession and carried secretly for days and days only to throw them under cover of <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b> among the grass in the corner of a field or beneath some hingeless door in some niche in the hedges where a girl might come upon them as she walked by and read them secretly. Mad! Mad! Was it possible he had done these things?A cold sweat broke out upon his forehead as the foul memories condensed within his brain.</p><hr>
<p> Rain was <b><font color='red'>falling</font></b> on the chapel, on the garden, on the college. It would rain for ever, noiselessly. The water would rise inch by inch, covering the grass and shrubs, covering the trees and houses, covering the monuments and the mountain tops. All life would be choked off, noiselessly: birds, men, elephants, pigs, children: noiselessly floating corpses amid the litter of the wreckage of the world. Forty days and forty <b><font color='blue'>nights</font></b> the rain would <b><font color='red'>fall</font></b> till the waters covered the face of the earth.</p><hr>
<p>â €” They lie in exterior <b><font color='blue'>darkness</font></b>. For, remember, the fire of hell gives forth no <b><font color='red'>light</font></b>. As, at the command of God, the fire of the Babylonian furnace lost its heat but not its <b><font color='red'>light</font></b>, so, at the command of God, the fire of hell, while retaining the intensity of its heat, burns eternally in <b><font color='blue'>darkness</font></b>. It is a never ending storm of <b><font color='blue'>darkness</font></b>, <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> flames and <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> smoke of burning brimstone, amid which the bodies are heaped one upon another without even a glimpse of air. Of all the plagues with which the land of the Pharaohs were smitten one plague alone, that of <b><font color='blue'>darkness</font></b>, was called horrible. What name, then, shall we give to the <b><font color='blue'>darkness</font></b> of hell which is to last not for three days alone but for all eternity?</p><hr>
<p>â €” HE ONCE HAD MEANT TO COME ON EARTH IN HEAVENLY GLORY BUT WE SINNED; AND THEN HE COULD NOT SAFELY VISIT US BUT WITHA SHROUDED MAJESTY ANDA BEDIMMED RADIANCE FOR HE WAS GOD. SO HE CAME HIMSELF IN WEAKNESS NOT IN POWER AND HE SENT THEE,A CREATURE IN HIS STEAD, WITHA CREATURE'S COMELINESS AND LUSTRE SUITED TO OUR STATE. AND NOW THY VERY FACE AND FORM, DEAR MOTHER SPEAK TO US OF THE ETERNAL NOT LIKE EARTHLY BEAUTY, DANGEROUS TO LOOK UPON, BUT LIKE THE MORNING STAR WHICH IS THY EMBLEM, BRIGHT AND MUSICAL, BREATHING PURITY, TELLING OF HEAVEN AND INFUSING PEACE.O HARBINGER OF DAY!O <b><font color='red'>LIGHT</font></b> OF THE PILGRIM! LEAD US STILL AS THOU HAST LED. IN THE <b><font color='blue'>DARK</font></b> <b><font color='blue'>NIGHT</font></b>, ACROSS THE BLEAK WILDERNESS GUIDE US ON TO OUR LORD JESUS, GUIDE US HOME.</p><hr>
<p> When evening had <b><font color='red'>fallen</font></b> he left the house, and the first touch of the damp <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> air and the noise of the door as it closed behind him made ache again his conscience, lulled by prayer and tears. Confess! Confess! It was not enough to lull the conscience with a tear and a prayer. He had to kneel before the minister of the Holy Ghost and tell over his hidden sins truly and repentantly. Before he heard again the footboard of the housedoor trail over the threshold as it opened to let him in, before he saw again the table in the kitchen set for supper he would have knelt and confessed. It was quite simple.</p><hr>
<p>A wasting breath of humiliation blew bleakly over his soul to think of how he had <b><font color='red'>fallen</font></b>, to feel that those souls were dearer to God than his. The wind blew over him and passed on to the myriads and myriads of other souls on whom God's favour shone now more and now less, stars now brighter and now dimmer sustained and failing. And the glimmering souls passed away, sustained and failing, merged in a moving breath. One soul was lost; a tiny soul: his. It flickered once and went out, forgotten, lost. The end: <b><font color='blue'>black</font></b>, cold, void waste.</p><hr>
<p> He could still leave the chapel. He could stand up, put one foot before the other and walk out softly and then run, run, run swiftly through the <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> streets. He could still escape from the shame. Had it been any terrible crime but that one sin! Had it been murder! Little fiery flakes fell and touched him at all points, shameful thoughts, shameful words, shameful acts. Shame covered him wholly like fine glowing ashes <b><font color='red'>falling</font></b> continually. To say it in words! His soul, stifling and helpless, would cease to be.</p><hr>
