<p>â €” An hour and twenty-five minutes, she said. The right time now is twenty past ten. The <b><font color='red'>dear</font></b> knows you might try to be in time for your lectures.</p><hr>
<p> When the enamelled basin had been fitted into the <b><font color='red'>well</font></b> of the sink and the old washing glove flung on the side of it he allowed his mother to scrub his neck and root into the folds of his ears and into the interstices at the wings of his nose.</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b>, it's a poor case, she said, when a university student is so dirty that his mother has to wash him.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Dry yourself and hurry out for the love of <b><font color='red'>goodness</font></b>.</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Good</font></b> morning, everybody, said Stephen, smiling and kissing the tips of his fingers in adieu.</p><hr>
<p> The homely version of his christian name on the lips of his friend had touched Stephen pleasantly when first heard for he was as formal in speech with others as they were with him. Often, as he sat in Davin's rooms in Grantham Street, wondering at his friend's <b><font color='red'>well</font></b>-made boots that flanked the wall pair by pair and repeating for his friend's simple ear the verses and cadences of others which were the veils of his own longing and dejection, the rude Firbolg mind of his listener had drawn his mind towards it and flung it back again, drawing it by a quiet inbred courtesy of attention or by a quaint turn of old English speech or by the force of its delight in rude bodily skillâ €” for Davin had sat at the feet of Michael Cusack, the Gaelâ €” repelling swiftly and suddenly by a grossness of intelligence or by a bluntness of feeling or by a dull stare of terror in the eyes, the terror of soul of a starving Irish village in which the curfew was still a nightly fear.</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b>,I suppose that doesn't interest you, but leastways there was such noise after the match thatI missed the train home andI couldn't get any kind of a yoke to give me a lift for, as luck would have it, there was a mass meeting that same day over in Castletownroche and all the cars in the country were there. So there was nothing for it only to stay the night or to foot it out. <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b>,I started to walk and onI went and it was coming on night whenI got into the Ballyhoura hills, that's better than ten miles from Kilmallock and there's a long lonely road after that. You wouldn't see the sign of a christian house along the road or hear a sound. It was pitch dark almost. Once or twiceI stopped by the way under a bush to redden my pipe and only for the dew was thickI'd have stretched out there and slept. At last, after a bend of the road,I spied a little cottage with a light in the window.I went up and knocked at the door.A voice asked who was there andI answeredI was over at the match in Buttevant and was walking back and thatI'd be thankful for a glass of water. After a while a young woman opened the door and brought me out a big mug of milk. She was half undressed as if she was going to bed whenI knocked and she had her hair hanging andI thought by her figure and by something in the look of her eyes that she must be carrying a child. She kept me in talk a long while at the door, andI thought it strange because her breast and her shoulders were bare. She asked me wasI tired and wouldI like to stop the night there. She said she was all alone in the house and that her husband had gone that morning to Queenstown with his sister to see her off. And all the time she was talking, Stevie, she had her eyes fixed on my face and she stood so close to meI could hear her breathing. WhenI handed her back the mug at last she took my hand to draw me in over the threshold and said:'COME IN AND STAY THE NIGHT HERE. YOU'VE NO CALL TO BE FRIGHTENED. THERE'S NO ONE IN IT BUT OURSELVES ...'I didn't go in, Stevie.I thanked her and went on my way again, all in a fever. At the first bend of the roadI looked back and she was standing at the door.</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b>, sure, you will some day, sir, please God, the girl answered after an instant.</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Good</font></b> morning, sir! CanI help you?</p><hr>
<p>â €” In so far as it is apprehended by the sight, whichI suppose means here esthetic intellection, it will be beautiful. But Aquinas also says BONUM EST IN QUOD TENDIT APPETITUS. In so far as it satisfies the animal craving for warmth fire is a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b>. In hell, however, it is an evil.</p><hr>
<p>â €” One difficulty, said Stephen, in esthetic discussion is to know whether words are being used according to the literary tradition or according to the tradition of the marketplace.I remember a sentence of Newman's in which he says of the Blessed Virgin that she was detained in the <b><font color='red'>full</font></b> company of the saints. The use of the word in the marketplace is quite different.I HOPEI AM NOT DETAINING YOU.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Tundish! <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b> now, that is interesting!</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Good</font></b> old Fresh Water Martin!</p><hr>
<p>â €” The affair doesn't interest me in the least, said Stephen wearily. You know that <b><font color='red'>well</font></b>. Why do you make a scene about it?</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Good</font></b>! said MacCann, smacking his lips. You are a reactionary, then?</p><hr>
<p>â €” By hell, that's a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> one! said the gipsy student to those about him, that's a fine expression.I like that expression immensely.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Dedalus, said MacCann crisply,I believe you're a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> fellow but you have yet to learn the dignity of altruism and the responsibility of the human individual.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Blast him, curse him! said Cranly broadly. Don't talk to him at all. Sure, you might as <b><font color='red'>well</font></b> be talking, do you know, to a flaming chamber-pot as talking to Temple. Go home, Temple. For God's sake, go home.</p><hr>
<p>â €” He uses the word VISA, said Stephen, to cover esthetic apprehensions of all kinds, whether through sight or hearing or through any other avenue of apprehension. This word, though it is vague, is clear enough to keep away <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> and evil which excite desire and loathing. It means certainly a stasis and not a kinesis. How about the true? It produces also a stasis of the mind. You would not write your name in pencil across the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle.</p><hr>
<p>â €” The Greek, the Turk, the Chinese, the Copt, the Hottentot, said Stephen, all admire a different type of female beauty. That seems to be a maze out of which we cannot escape.I see, however, two ways out. One is this hypothesis: that every physical quality admired by men in women is in direct connexion with the manifold functions of women for the propagation of the species. It may be so. The world, it seems, is drearier than even you, Lynch, imagined. For my partI dislike that way out. It leads to eugenics rather than to esthetic. It leads you out of the maze into a new gaudy lecture-room where MacCann, with one hand on THE ORIGIN OF SPECIES and the other hand on the new testament, tells you that you admired the great flanks of Venus because you felt that she would bear you burly offspring and admired her great breasts because you felt that she would give <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> milk to her children and yours.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Of course, said Lynch. After all Aquinas, in spite of his intellect, was exactly a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> round friar. But you will tell me about the new personal experience and new terminology some other day. Hurry up and finish the first part.</p><hr>
<p> IMPLETA SUNT QUAE CONCINIT DAVID FIDELI CARMINE DICENDO NATIONIBUS REGNAVITA LIGNO DEUS.â €” That's great! he said, <b><font color='red'>well</font></b> pleased. Great music!</p><hr>
<p>â €” To think that that yellow pancake-eating excrement can get a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> job, he said at length, andI have to smoke cheap cigarettes!</p><hr>
<p>â €”I have a book at home, said Stephen, in whichI have written down questions which are more amusing than yours were. In finding the answers to themI found the theory of esthetic whichI am trying to explain. Here are some questionsI set myself: ISA CHAIR FINELY MADE TRAGIC OR COMIC? IS THE PORTRAIT OF MONA LISA <b><font color='red'>GOOD</font></b> IFI DESIRE TO SEE IT? IF NOT, WHY NOT?</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Depends</font></b> on the practice.</p><hr>
<p> Bah! he had done <b><font color='red'>well</font></b> to leave the room in disdain. He had done <b><font color='red'>well</font></b> not to salute her on the steps of the library! He had done <b><font color='red'>well</font></b> to leave her to flirt with her priest, to toy with a church which was the scullery-maid of christendom.</p><hr>
<p> The <b><font color='red'>full</font></b> morning light had come. No sound was to be heard; but he knew that all around him life was about to awaken in common noises, hoarse voices, sleepy prayers. Shrinking from that life he turned towards the wall, making a cowl of the blanket and staring at the great overblown scarlet flowers of the tattered wallpaper. He tried to warm his perishing joy in their scarlet glow, imagining a roseway from where he lay upwards to heaven all strewn with scarlet flowers. Weary! Weary! He too was weary of ardent ways.</p><hr>
<p> Why was he gazing upwards from the steps of the porch, hearing their shrill twofold cry, watching their flight? For an augury of <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> or evil?A phrase of Cornelius Agrippa flew through his mind and then there flew hither and thither shapeless thoughts from Swedenborg on the correspondence of birds to things of the intellect and of how the creatures of the air have their knowledge and know their times and seasons because they, unlike man, are in the order of their life and have not perverted that order by reason.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Our men retired in <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> order.</p><hr>
<p> Cranly did not answer or turn. He laid his book on the counter and passed out, his <b><font color='red'>well</font></b>-shod feet sounding flatly on the floor. On the staircase he paused and gazing absently at Dixon repeated:</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Good</font></b> evening, gentlemen, said the stubble-grown monkeyish face.</p><hr>
<p>â €” You're a hypocrite,O'Keeffe, he said. And Dixon is a smiler. By hell,I think that's a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> literary expression.</p><hr>
<p> Goggins skipped down on to the gravel and at once returned to his place with <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> humour. Temple turned back to Stephen and asked:</p><hr>
<p>â €” Cranly, you're always sneering at me.I can see that. ButI am as <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> as you any day. Do you know whatI think about you now as compared with myself?</p><hr>
<p>â €” My <b><font color='red'>dear</font></b> man, said Cranly urbanely, you are incapable, do you know, absolutely incapable of thinking.</p><hr>
<p> He came back quickly along the colonnade towards the group of students. <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b> then, let her go and be damned to her! She could love some clean athlete who washed himself every morning to the waist and had black hair on his chest. Let her.</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Good</font></b> evening, sirs.</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Good</font></b> evening, particularly to you.</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Good</font></b>? Yes. It is a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> evening.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Very <b><font color='red'>well</font></b>, then, Temple continued, still addressing Glynn, and if Jesus suffered the children to come why does the church send them all to hell if they die unbaptized? Why is that?</p><hr>
<p>â €” Go easy, my <b><font color='red'>dear</font></b> man. You're an excitable bloody man, do you know.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Don't, please. You cannot discuss this question with your mouth <b><font color='red'>full</font></b> of chewed fig.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Was your father ... Cranly interrupted himself for an instant, and then said:I don't want to pry into your family affairs. But was your father what is called <b><font color='red'>well</font></b>-to-do?I mean, when you were growing up?</p><hr>
<p>â €”A medical student, an oarsman, a tenor, an amateur actor, a shouting politician, a small landlord, a small investor, a drinker, a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> fellow, a story-teller, somebody's secretary, something in a distillery, a tax-gatherer, a bankrupt and at present a praiser of his own past.</p><hr>
<p>â €” The distillery is damn <b><font color='red'>good</font></b>.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Are you in <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> circumstances at present?</p><hr>
<p>â €” Your mother must have gone through a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> deal of suffering, he said then. Would you not try to save her from suffering more even if ... or would you?</p><hr>
<p>â €” Because, Cranly continued, you need not look upon yourself as driven away if you do not wish to go or as a heretic or an outlaw. There are many <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> believers who think as you do. Would that surprise you? The church is not the stone building nor even the clergy and their dogmas. It is the whole mass of those born into it.I don't know what you wish to do in life. Is it what you told me the night we were standing outside Harcourt Street station?</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b>? Stephen said. Do you remember the rest?</p><hr>
<p> Then went to college. Other wrangle with little round head rogue's eye Ghezzi. This time about Bruno the Nolan. Began in Italian and ended in pidgin English. He said Bruno was a terrible heretic.I said he was terribly burned. He agreed to this with some sorrow. Then gave me recipe for what he calls RISOTTO ALLA BERGAMASCA. When he pronounces a softO he protrudes his <b><font color='red'>full</font></b> carnal lips as if he kissed the vowel. Has he? And could he repent? Yes, he could: and cry two round rogue's tears, one from each eye.</p><hr>
<p> APRIL2. Saw her drinking tea and eating cakes in Johnston's, Mooney andO'Brien's. Rather, lynx-eyed Lynch saw her as we passed. He tells me Cranly was invited there by brother. Did he bring his crocodile? Is he the shining light now? <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b>,I discovered him.I protestI did. Shining quietly behind a bushel of Wicklow bran.</p><hr>
<p> APRIL3. Met Davin at the cigar shop opposite Findlater's church. He was in a black sweater and had a hurley stick. Asked me was it trueI was going away and why. Told him the shortest way to Tara was VIA Holyhead. Just then my father came up. Introduction. Father polite and observant. Asked Davin if he might offer him some refreshment. Davin could not, was going to a meeting. When we came away father told me he had a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> honest eye. Asked me whyI did not join a rowing club.I pretended to think it over. Told me then how he broke Pennyfeather's heart. Wants me to read law. SaysI was cut out for that. More mud, more crocodiles.</p><hr>
<p> APRIL6. Certainly she remembers the past. Lynch says all women do. Then she remembers the time of her childhoodâ €” and mine, ifI was ever a child. The past is consumed in the present and the present is living only because it brings forth the future. Statues of women, if Lynch be right, should always be <b><font color='red'>fully</font></b> draped, one hand of the woman feeling regretfully her own hinder parts.</p><hr>
<p> APRIL 13. That tundish has been on my mind for a long time.I looked it up and find it English and <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> old blunt English too. Damn the dean of studies and his funnel! What did he come here for to teach us his own language or to learn it from us. Damn him one way or the other!</p><hr>
<p> APRIL 27. Old father, old artificer, stand me now and ever in <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> stead.</p><hr>
