<p>â €” <b><font color='blue'>Well</font></b>,I suppose that doesn't interest you, but leastways there was such noise after the match thatI missed the train home andI couldn't get any kind of a yoke to give me a lift for, as luck would have it, there was a mass meeting that same day over in Castletownroche and all the cars in the country were there. So there was nothing for it only to stay the night or to foot it out. <b><font color='blue'>Well</font></b>,I started to walk and onI went and it was coming on night whenI got into the Ballyhoura hills, that's better than ten miles from Kilmallock and there's a long lonely road after that. You wouldn't see the sign of a christian house along the road or hear a sound. It was pitch dark almost. Once or twiceI stopped by the way under a bush to redden my pipe and only for the dew was thickI'd have stretched out there and slept. At last, after a bend of the road,I spied a little cottage with a <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> in the window.I went up and knocked at the door.A voice asked who was there andI answeredI was over at the match in Buttevant and was walking back and thatI'd be thankful for a glass of water. After a while a young woman opened the door and brought me out a big mug of milk. She was half undressed as if she was going to bed whenI knocked and she had her hair hanging andI thought by her figure and by something in the look of her eyes that she must be carrying a child. She kept me in talk a long while at the door, andI thought it strange because her breast and her shoulders were bare. She asked me wasI tired and wouldI like to stop the night there. She said she was all alone in the house and that her husband had gone that morning to Queenstown with his sister to see her off. And all the time she was talking, Stevie, she had her eyes fixed on my face and she stood so close to meI could hear her breathing. WhenI handed her back the mug at last she took my hand to draw me in over the threshold and said:'COME IN AND STAY THE NIGHT HERE. YOU'VE NO CALL TO BE FRIGHTENED. THERE'S NO ONE IN IT BUT OURSELVES ...'I didn't go in, Stevie.I thanked her and went on my way again, all in a fever. At the first bend of the roadI looked back and she was standing at the door.</p><hr>
<p> The <b><font color='blue'>full</font></b> morning <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> had come. No sound was to be heard; but he knew that all around him life was about to awaken in common noises, hoarse voices, sleepy prayers. Shrinking from that life he turned towards the wall, making a cowl of the blanket and staring at the great overblown scarlet flowers of the tattered wallpaper. He tried to warm his perishing joy in their scarlet glow, imagining a roseway from where he lay upwards to heaven all strewn with scarlet flowers. Weary! Weary! He too was weary of ardent ways.</p><hr>
<p> He came back quickly along the colonnade towards the group of students. <b><font color='blue'>Well</font></b> then, let her go and be damned to her! She could love some <b><font color='red'>clean</font></b> athlete who washed himself every morning to the waist and had black hair on his chest. Let her.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Go <b><font color='red'>easy</font></b>, my <b><font color='blue'>dear</font></b> man. You're an excitable bloody man, do you know.</p><hr>
<p> APRIL2. Saw her drinking tea and eating cakes in Johnston's, Mooney andO'Brien's. Rather, lynx-eyed Lynch saw her as we passed. He tells me Cranly was invited there by brother. Did he bring his crocodile? Is he the shining <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> now? <b><font color='blue'>Well</font></b>,I discovered him.I protestI did. Shining quietly behind a bushel of Wicklow bran.</p><hr>
