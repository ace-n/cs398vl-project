<p>'Tis youth and folly Makes young men marry, So here, my love,I'll No longer stay. What can't be cured, sure, Must be injured, sure, SoI'll go to Amerikay. My love she's handsome, My love she's bony: She's like <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> whisky When it is new; But when'tis old And growing <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> It fades and dies like The mountain dew.</p><hr>
