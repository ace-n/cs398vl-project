<p> It would be nice to lie on the hearthrug before the fire, leaning his head upon his hands, and think on those sentences. He shivered as if he had <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> slimy water next his skin. That was mean of <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b> to shoulder him into the square ditch because he would not swop his little snuff box for <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b>'s seasoned hacking chestnut, the conqueror of forty. How <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> and slimy the water had been!A fellow had once seen a big rat jump into the scum. Mother was sitting at the fire with Dante waiting for Brigid to bring in the tea. She had her feet on the fender and her jewelly slippers were so hot and they had such a lovely warm smell! Dante knew a lot of things. She had taught him where the Mozambique Channel was and what was the longest river in America and what was the name of the highest mountain in the moon. Father Arnall knew more than Dante because he was a priest but both his father and uncle Charles said that Dante was a clever woman and a <b><font color='red'>well</font></b>-read woman. And when Dante made that noise after dinner and then put up her hand to her mouth: that was heartburn.</p><hr>
<p> They all laughed again. Stephen tried to laugh with them. He felt his whole body hot and confused in a moment. What was the right answer to the question? He had given two and still <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b> laughed. But <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b> must know the right answer for he was in third of grammar. He tried to think of <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b>'s mother but he did not dare to raise his eyes to <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b>'s face. He did not like <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b>'s face. It was <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b> who had shouldered him into the square ditch the day before because he would not swop his little snuff box for <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b>'s seasoned hacking chestnut, the conqueror of forty. It was a mean thing to do; all the fellows said it was. And how <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> and slimy the water had been! And a fellow had once seen a big rat jump plop into the scum.</p><hr>
<p> The <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> slime of the ditch covered his whole body; and, when the bell rang for study and the lines filed out of the playrooms, he felt the <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> air of the corridor and staircase inside his clothes. He still tried to think what was the right answer. Was it right to kiss his mother or wrong to kiss his mother? What did that mean, to kiss? You put your face up like that to say <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> night and then his mother put her face down. That was to kiss. His mother put her lips on his cheek; her lips were soft and they wetted his cheek; and they made a tiny little noise: kiss. Why did people do that with their two faces?</p><hr>
<p> It pained him that he did not know <b><font color='red'>well</font></b> what politics meant and that he did not know where the universe ended. He felt small and weak. When would he be like the fellows in poetry and rhetoric? They had big voices and big boots and they studied trigonometry. That was very far away. First came the vacation and then the next term and then vacation again and then again another term and then again the vacation. It was like a train going in and out of tunnels and that was like the noise of the boys eating in the refectory when you opened and closed the flaps of the ears. Term, vacation; tunnel, out; noise, stop. How far away it was! It was better to go to bed to sleep. Only prayers in the chapel and then bed. He shivered and yawned. It would be lovely in bed after the sheets got a bit hot. First they were so <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> to get into. He shivered to think how <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> they were first. But then they got hot and then he could sleep. It was lovely to be tired. He yawned again. Night prayers and then bed: he shivered and wanted to yawn. It would be lovely in a few minutes. He felt a warm glow creeping up from the <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> shivering sheets, warmer and warmer till he felt warm all over, ever so warm and yet he shivered a little and still wanted to yawn.</p><hr>
<p> He blessed himself and climbed quickly into bed and, tucking the end of the nightshirt under his feet, curled himself together under the <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> white sheets, shaking and trembling. But he would not go to hell when he died; and the shaking would stop.A voice bade the boys in the dormitory <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> night. He peered out for an instant over the coverlet and saw the yellow curtains round and before his bed that shut him off on all sides. The light was lowered quietly.</p><hr>
<p> It was not <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b>'s face, it was the prefect's. He was not foxing. No, no: he was sick really. He was not foxing. And he felt the prefect's hand on his forehead; and he felt his forehead warm and damp against the prefect's <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> damp hand. That was the way a rat felt, slimy and damp and <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b>. Every rat had two eyes to look out of. Sleek slimy coats, little little feet tucked up to jump, black slimy eyes to look out of. They could understand how to jump. But the minds of rats could not understand trigonometry. When they were dead they lay on their sides. Their coats dried then. They were only dead things.</p><hr>
<p> How far away they were! There was <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> sunlight outside the window. He wondered if he would die. You could die just the same on a sunny day. He might die before his mother came. Then he would have a dead mass in the chapel like the way the fellows had told him it was when Little had died. All the fellows would be at the mass, dressed in black, all with sad faces. <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b> too would be there but no fellow would look at him. The rector would be there in a cope of black and gold and there would be tall yellow candles on the altar and round the catafalque. And they would carry the coffin out of the chapel slowly and he would be buried in the little graveyard of the community off the main avenue of limes. And <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b> would be sorry then for what he had done. And the bell would toll slowly.</p><hr>
<p>â €”I let her bawl away, said Mr Casey. It was a <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> day and to keep up my heartI had( saving your presence, ma'am) a quid of Tullamore in my mouth and sureI couldn't say a word in any case because my mouth was <b><font color='red'>full</font></b> of tobacco juice.</p><hr>
