<p> It would be nice to lie on the hearthrug before the fire, leaning his head upon his hands, and think on those sentences. He shivered as if he had <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> slimy water next his skin. That was mean of Wells to shoulder him into the square ditch because he would not swop his little snuff box for Wells's seasoned hacking chestnut, the conqueror of forty. How <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> and slimy the water had been!A fellow had once seen a big rat jump into the scum. Mother was sitting at the fire with Dante waiting for Brigid to bring in the tea. She had her feet on the fender and her jewelly slippers were so <b><font color='red'>hot</font></b> and they had such a lovely warm smell! Dante knew a lot of things. She had taught him where the Mozambique Channel was and what was the longest river in America and what was the name of the highest mountain in the moon. Father Arnall knew more than Dante because he was a priest but both his father and uncle Charles said that Dante was a clever woman and a well-read woman. And when Dante made that noise after dinner and then put up her hand to her mouth: that was heartburn.</p><hr>
<p> To remember that and the white look of the lavatory made him feel <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> and then <b><font color='red'>hot</font></b>. There were two cocks that you turned and water came out: <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> and <b><font color='red'>hot</font></b>. He felt <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> and then a little <b><font color='red'>hot</font></b>: and he could see the names printed on the cocks. That was a very queer thing.</p><hr>
<p> The bell rang and then the classes began to file out of the rooms and along the corridors towards the refectory. He sat looking at the two prints of butter on his plate but could not eat the damp bread. The tablecloth was damp and limp. But he drank off the <b><font color='red'>hot</font></b> weak tea which the clumsy scullion, girt with a white apron, poured into his cup. He wondered whether the scullion's apron was damp too or whether all white things were <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> and damp. Nasty Roche and Saurin drank cocoa that their people sent them in tins. They said they could not drink the tea; that it was hogwash. Their fathers were magistrates, the fellows said.</p><hr>
<p> They all laughed again. Stephen tried to laugh with them. He felt his whole body <b><font color='red'>hot</font></b> and confused in a moment. What was the right answer to the question? He had given two and still Wells laughed. But Wells must know the right answer for he was in third of grammar. He tried to think of Wells's mother but he did not dare to raise his eyes to Wells's face. He did not like Wells's face. It was Wells who had shouldered him into the square ditch the day before because he would not swop his little snuff box for Wells's seasoned hacking chestnut, the conqueror of forty. It was a mean thing to do; all the fellows said it was. And how <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> and slimy the water had been! And a fellow had once seen a big rat jump plop into the scum.</p><hr>
<p> It pained him that he did not know well what politics meant and that he did not know where the universe ended. He felt small and weak. When would he be like the fellows in poetry and rhetoric? They had big voices and big boots and they studied trigonometry. That was very far away. First came the vacation and then the next term and then vacation again and then again another term and then again the vacation. It was like a train going in and out of tunnels and that was like the noise of the boys eating in the refectory when you opened and closed the flaps of the ears. Term, vacation; tunnel, out; noise, stop. How far away it was! It was better to go to bed to sleep. Only prayers in the chapel and then bed. He shivered and yawned. It would be lovely in bed after the sheets got a bit <b><font color='red'>hot</font></b>. First they were so <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> to get into. He shivered to think how <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> they were first. But then they got <b><font color='red'>hot</font></b> and then he could sleep. It was lovely to be tired. He yawned again. Night prayers and then bed: he shivered and wanted to yawn. It would be lovely in a few minutes. He felt a warm glow creeping up from the <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> shivering sheets, warmer and warmer till he felt warm all over, ever so warm and yet he shivered a little and still wanted to yawn.</p><hr>
<p> The <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> sunlight was weaker and Brother Michael was standing at his bedside with a bowl of beef-tea. He was glad for his mouth was <b><font color='red'>hot</font></b> and dry. He could hear them playing in the playgrounds. And the day was going on in the college just as if he were there.</p><hr>
