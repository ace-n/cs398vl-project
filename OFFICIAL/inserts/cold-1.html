<p>O, the green wothe botheth. When you wet the bed first it is warm then it gets <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b>. His mother put on the oilsheet. That had the queer smell.</p><hr>
<p> He crept about from point to point on the fringe of his line, making little runs now and then. But his hands were bluish with <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b>. He kept his hands in the side pockets of his belted grey suit. That was a belt round his pocket. And belt was also to give a fellow a belt. One day a fellow said to Cantwell:</p><hr>
<p> It would be better to be in the study hall than out there in the <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b>. The sky was pale and <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> but there were lights in the castle. He wondered from which window Hamilton Rowan had thrown his hat on the ha-ha and had there been flowerbeds at that time under the windows. One day when he had been called to the castle the butler had shown him the marks of the soldiers'slugs in the wood of the door and had given him a piece of shortbread that the community ate. It was nice and warm to see the lights in the castle. It was like something in a book. Perhaps Leicester Abbey was like that. And there were nice sentences in Doctor Cornwell's Spelling Book. They were like poetry but they were only sentences to learn the spelling from.</p><hr>
<p> It would be nice to lie on the hearthrug before the fire, leaning his head upon his hands, and think on those sentences. He shivered as if he had <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> slimy water next his skin. That was mean of Wells to shoulder him into the square ditch because he would not swop his little snuff box for Wells's seasoned hacking chestnut, the conqueror of forty. How <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> and slimy the water had been!A fellow had once seen a big rat jump into the scum. Mother was sitting at the fire with Dante waiting for Brigid to bring in the tea. She had her feet on the fender and her jewelly slippers were so hot and they had such a lovely warm smell! Dante knew a lot of things. She had taught him where the Mozambique Channel was and what was the longest river in America and what was the name of the highest mountain in the moon. Father Arnall knew more than Dante because he was a priest but both his father and uncle Charles said that Dante was a clever woman and a well-read woman. And when Dante made that noise after dinner and then put up her hand to her mouth: that was heartburn.</p><hr>
<p> To remember that and the white look of the lavatory made him feel <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> and then hot. There were two cocks that you turned and water came out: <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> and hot. He felt <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> and then a little hot: and he could see the names printed on the cocks. That was a very queer thing.</p><hr>
<p> The bell rang and then the classes began to file out of the rooms and along the corridors towards the refectory. He sat looking at the two prints of butter on his plate but could not eat the damp bread. The tablecloth was damp and limp. But he drank off the hot weak tea which the clumsy scullion, girt with a white apron, poured into his cup. He wondered whether the scullion's apron was damp too or whether all white things were <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> and damp. Nasty Roche and Saurin drank cocoa that their people sent them in tins. They said they could not drink the tea; that it was hogwash. Their fathers were magistrates, the fellows said.</p><hr>
<p> They all laughed again. Stephen tried to laugh with them. He felt his whole body hot and confused in a moment. What was the right answer to the question? He had given two and still Wells laughed. But Wells must know the right answer for he was in third of grammar. He tried to think of Wells's mother but he did not dare to raise his eyes to Wells's face. He did not like Wells's face. It was Wells who had shouldered him into the square ditch the day before because he would not swop his little snuff box for Wells's seasoned hacking chestnut, the conqueror of forty. It was a mean thing to do; all the fellows said it was. And how <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> and slimy the water had been! And a fellow had once seen a big rat jump plop into the scum.</p><hr>
<p> The <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> slime of the ditch covered his whole body; and, when the bell rang for study and the lines filed out of the playrooms, he felt the <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> air of the corridor and staircase inside his clothes. He still tried to think what was the right answer. Was it right to kiss his mother or wrong to kiss his mother? What did that mean, to kiss? You put your face up like that to say good night and then his mother put her face down. That was to kiss. His mother put her lips on his cheek; her lips were soft and they wetted his cheek; and they made a tiny little noise: kiss. Why did people do that with their two faces?</p><hr>
<p> It pained him that he did not know well what politics meant and that he did not know where the universe ended. He felt small and weak. When would he be like the fellows in poetry and rhetoric? They had big voices and big boots and they studied trigonometry. That was very far away. First came the vacation and then the next term and then vacation again and then again another term and then again the vacation. It was like a train going in and out of tunnels and that was like the noise of the boys eating in the refectory when you opened and closed the flaps of the ears. Term, vacation; tunnel, out; noise, stop. How far away it was! It was better to go to bed to sleep. Only prayers in the chapel and then bed. He shivered and yawned. It would be lovely in bed after the sheets got a bit hot. First they were so <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> to get into. He shivered to think how <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> they were first. But then they got hot and then he could sleep. It was lovely to be tired. He yawned again. Night prayers and then bed: he shivered and wanted to yawn. It would be lovely in a few minutes. He felt a warm glow creeping up from the <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> shivering sheets, warmer and warmer till he felt warm all over, ever so warm and yet he shivered a little and still wanted to yawn.</p><hr>
<p> The bell rang for night prayers and he filed out of the study hall after the others and down the staircase and along the corridors to the chapel. The corridors were darkly lit and the chapel was darkly lit. Soon all would be dark and sleeping. There was <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> night air in the chapel and the marbles were the colour the sea was at night. The sea was <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> day and night: but it was <b><font color='red'>colder</font></b> at night. It was <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> and dark under the seawall beside his father's house. But the kettle would be on the hob to make punch.</p><hr>
<p> There was a <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> night smell in the chapel. But it was a holy smell. It was not like the smell of the old peasants who knelt at the back of the chapel at Sunday mass. That was a smell of air and rain and turf and corduroy. But they were very holy peasants. They breathed behind him on his neck and sighed as they prayed. They lived in Clane, a fellow said: there were little cottages there and he had seen a woman standing at the half-door of a cottage with a child in her arms as the cars had come past from Sallins. It would be lovely to sleep for one night in that cottage before the fire of smoking turf, in the dark lit by the fire, in the warm dark, breathing the smell of the peasants, air and rain and turf and corduroy. ButO, the road there between the trees was dark! You would be lost in the dark. It made him afraid to think of how it was.</p><hr>
<p> He blessed himself and climbed quickly into bed and, tucking the end of the nightshirt under his feet, curled himself together under the <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> white sheets, shaking and trembling. But he would not go to hell when he died; and the shaking would stop.A voice bade the boys in the dormitory good night. He peered out for an instant over the coverlet and saw the yellow curtains round and before his bed that shut him off on all sides. The light was lowered quietly.</p><hr>
<p>O how <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> and strange it was to think of that! All the dark was <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> and strange. There were pale strange faces there, great eyes like carriage-lamps. They were the ghosts of murderers, the figures of marshals who had received their death-wound on battlefields far away over the sea. What did they wish to say that their faces were so strange?</p><hr>
<p> He got up and sat on the side of his bed. He was weak. He tried to pull on his stocking. It had a horrid rough feel. The sunlight was queer and <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b>.</p><hr>
<p> It was not Wells's face, it was the prefect's. He was not foxing. No, no: he was sick really. He was not foxing. And he felt the prefect's hand on his forehead; and he felt his forehead warm and damp against the prefect's <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> damp hand. That was the way a rat felt, slimy and damp and <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b>. Every rat had two eyes to look out of. Sleek slimy coats, little little feet tucked up to jump, black slimy eyes to look out of. They could understand how to jump. But the minds of rats could not understand trigonometry. When they were dead they lay on their sides. Their coats dried then. They were only dead things.</p><hr>
<p> How far away they were! There was <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> sunlight outside the window. He wondered if he would die. You could die just the same on a sunny day. He might die before his mother came. Then he would have a dead mass in the chapel like the way the fellows had told him it was when Little had died. All the fellows would be at the mass, dressed in black, all with sad faces. Wells too would be there but no fellow would look at him. The rector would be there in a cope of black and gold and there would be tall yellow candles on the altar and round the catafalque. And they would carry the coffin out of the chapel slowly and he would be buried in the little graveyard of the community off the main avenue of limes. And Wells would be sorry then for what he had done. And the bell would toll slowly.</p><hr>
<p> The <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> sunlight was weaker and Brother Michael was standing at his bedside with a bowl of beef-tea. He was glad for his mouth was hot and dry. He could hear them playing in the playgrounds. And the day was going on in the college just as if he were there.</p><hr>
<p>â €” We are all sinners and black sinners, said Mr Casey <b><font color='red'>coldly</font></b>.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Tub of guts, said Mr Dedalus coarsely. He has a handsome face, mind you, in repose. You should see that fellow lapping up his bacon and cabbage of a <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> winter's day.O Johnny!</p><hr>
<p> Eileen had long white hands. One evening when playing tig she had put her hands over his eyes: long and white and thin and <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> and soft. That was ivory: a <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> white thing. That was the meaning of TOWER OF IVORY.</p><hr>
<p>â €” The story is very short and sweet, Mr Casey said. It was one day down in Arklow, a <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> bitter day, not long before the chief died. May God have mercy on him!</p><hr>
<p>â €”I let her bawl away, said Mr Casey. It was a <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> day and to keep up my heartI had( saving your presence, ma'am) a quid of Tullamore in my mouth and sureI couldn't say a word in any case because my mouth was full of tobacco juice.</p><hr>
<p> It can't be helped; It must be done. So down with your breeches And out with your bum. The fellows laughed; but he felt that they were a little afraid. In the silence of the soft grey air he heard the cricket bats from here and from there: pock. That was a sound to hear but if you were hit then you would feel a pain. The pandybat made a sound too but not like that. The fellows said it was made of whalebone and leather with lead inside: and he wondered what was the pain like. There were different kinds of sounds.A long thin cane would have a high whistling sound and he wondered what was that pain like. It made him shivery to think of it and <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b>: and what Athy said too. But what was there to laugh at in it? It made him shivery: but that was because you always felt like a shiver when you let down your trousers. It was the same in the bath when you undressed yourself. He wondered who had to let them down, the master or the boy himself.O how could they laugh about it that way?</p><hr>
<p> He looked at Athy's rolled-up sleeves and knuckly inky hands. He had rolled up his sleeves to show how Mr Gleeson would roll up his sleeves. But Mr Gleeson had round shiny cuffs and clean white wrists and fattish white hands and the nails of them were long and pointed. Perhaps he pared them too like Lady Boyle. But they were terribly long and pointed nails. So long and cruel they were, though the white fattish hands were not cruel but gentle. And though he trembled with <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> and fright to think of the cruel long nails and of the high whistling sound of the cane and of the chill you felt at the end of your shirt when you undressed yourself yet he felt a feeling of queer quiet pleasure inside him to think of the white fattish hands, clean and strong and gentle. And he thought of what Cecil Thunder had said: that Mr Gleeson would not flog Corrigan hard. And Fleming had said he would not because it was best of his play not to. But that was not why</p><hr>
