<p> The rain-laden trees of the avenue evoked in him, as always, memories of the girls and women in the plays of Gerhart Hauptmann; and the memory of their pale sorrows and the fragrance <b><font color='red'>falling</font></b> from the wet branches mingled in a mood of quiet joy. His morning walk across the city had begun, and he foreknew that as he passed the sloblands of Fairview he would think of the cloistral silver-veined prose of Newman; that as he walked along the North Strand Road, glancing idly at the windows of the provision shops, he would recall the <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> humour of Guido Cavalcanti and smile; that as he went by Baird's stonecutting works in Talbot Place the spirit of Ibsen would blow through him like a keen wind, a spirit of wayward boyish beauty; and that passing a grimy marine dealer's shop beyond the Liffey he would repeat the song by Ben Jonson which begins:</p><hr>
<p> Eleven! Then he was late for that lecture too. What day of the week was it? He stopped at a newsagent's to read the headline of a placard. Thursday. Ten to eleven, English; eleven to twelve, French; twelve to one, physics. He fancied to himself the English lecture and felt, even at that distance, restless and helpless. He saw the heads of his classmates meekly bent as they wrote in their notebooks the points they were bidden to note, nominal definitions, essential definitions and examples or dates of birth or death, chief works, a favourable and an unfavourable criticism side by side. His own head was unbent for his thoughts wandered abroad and whether he looked around the little class of students or out of the window across the desolate gardens of the green an odour assailed him of cheerless cellar-damp and decay. Another head than his, right before him in the first benches, was poised squarely above its bending fellows like the head of a priest appealing without humility to the tabernacle for the humble worshippers about him. Why was it that when he thought of Cranly he could never raise before his mind the entire image of his body but only the image of the head and face? Even now against the grey curtain of the morning he saw it before him like the phantom of a dream, the face of a severed head or death-mask, crowned on the brows by its stiff <b><font color='blue'>black</font></b> upright hair as by an iron crown. It was a priest-like face, priest-like in its palor, in the wide winged nose, in the shadowings below the eyes and along the jaws, priest-like in the lips that were long and bloodless and <b><font color='red'>faintly</font></b> smiling; and Stephen, remembering swiftly how he had told Cranly of all the tumults and unrest and longings in his soul, day after day and <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b> by <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b>, only to be answered by his friend's listening silence, would have told himself that it was the face of a guilty priest who heard confessions of those whom he had not power to absolve but that he felt again in memory the gaze of its <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> womanish eyes.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Well,I suppose that doesn't interest you, but leastways there was such noise after the match thatI missed the train home andI couldn't get any kind of a yoke to give me a lift for, as luck would have it, there was a mass meeting that same day over in Castletownroche and all the cars in the country were there. So there was nothing for it only to stay the <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b> or to foot it out. Well,I started to walk and onI went and it was coming on <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b> whenI got into the Ballyhoura hills, that's better than ten miles from Kilmallock and there's a long lonely road after that. You wouldn't see the sign of a christian house along the road or hear a sound. It was pitch <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> almost. Once or twiceI stopped by the way under a bush to redden my pipe and only for the dew was thickI'd have stretched out there and slept. At last, after a bend of the road,I spied a little cottage with a <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> in the window.I went up and knocked at the door.A voice asked who was there andI answeredI was over at the match in Buttevant and was walking back and thatI'd be thankful for a glass of water. After a while a young woman opened the door and brought me out a big mug of milk. She was half undressed as if she was going to bed whenI knocked and she had her hair hanging andI thought by her figure and by something in the look of her eyes that she must be carrying a child. She kept me in talk a long while at the door, andI thought it strange because her breast and her shoulders were bare. She asked me wasI tired and wouldI like to stop the <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b> there. She said she was all alone in the house and that her husband had gone that morning to Queenstown with his sister to see her off. And all the time she was talking, Stevie, she had her eyes fixed on my face and she stood so close to meI could hear her breathing. WhenI handed her back the mug at last she took my hand to draw me in over the threshold and said:'COME IN AND STAY THE <b><font color='blue'>NIGHT</font></b> HERE. YOU'VE NO CALL TO BE FRIGHTENED. THERE'S NO ONE IN IT BUT OURSELVES ...'I didn't go in, Stevie.I thanked her and went on my way again, all in a fever. At the first bend of the roadI looked back and she was standing at the door.</p><hr>
<p> Stephen, checked by the crowd at the door, halted irresolutely. From under the wide <b><font color='red'>falling</font></b> leaf of a soft hat Cranly's <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> eyes were watching him.</p><hr>
<p> The quick <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> shower had drawn off, tarrying in clusters of diamonds among the shrubs of the quadrangle where an exhalation was breathed forth by the <b><font color='blue'>blackened</font></b> earth. Their trim boots prattled as they stood on the steps of the colonnade, talking quietly and gaily, glancing at the clouds, holding their umbrellas at cunning angles against the few last raindrops, closing them again, holding their skirts demurely.</p><hr>
<p> At certain instants her eyes seemed about to trust him but he had waited in vain. She passed now dancing <b><font color='red'>lightly</font></b> across his memory as she had been that <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b> at the carnival ball, her white dress a little lifted, a white spray nodding in her hair. She danced <b><font color='red'>lightly</font></b> in the round. She was dancing towards him and, as she came, her eyes were a little averted and a <b><font color='red'>faint</font></b> glow was on her cheek. At the pause in the chain of hands her hand had lain in his an instant, a soft merchandise.</p><hr>
<p> He had written verses for her again after ten years. Ten years before she had worn her shawl cowlwise about her head, sending sprays of her warm breath into the <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b> air, tapping her foot upon the glassy road. It was the last tram; the lank brown horses knew it and shook their bells to the clear <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b> in admonition. The conductor talked with the driver, both nodding often in the green <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> of the lamp. They stood on the steps of the tram, he on the upper, she on the lower. She came up to his step many times between their phrases and went down again and once or twice remained beside him forgetting to go down and then went down. Let be! Let be!</p><hr>
<p> She had passed through the dusk. And therefore the air was silent save for one soft hiss that fell. And therefore the tongues about him had ceased their babble. <b><font color='blue'>Darkness</font></b> was <b><font color='red'>falling</font></b>.</p><hr>
<p> <b><font color='blue'>Darkness</font></b> <b><font color='red'>falls</font></b> from the air.A trembling joy, lambent as a <b><font color='red'>faint</font></b> <b><font color='red'>light</font></b>, played like a fairy host around him. But why? Her passage through the <b><font color='blue'>darkening</font></b> air or the verse with its <b><font color='blue'>black</font></b> vowels and its opening sound, rich and lutelike?</p><hr>
<p> Eyes, opening from the <b><font color='blue'>darkness</font></b> of desire, eyes that dimmed the breaking east. What was their languid grace but the softness of chambering? And what was their shimmer but the shimmer of the scum that mantled the cesspool of the court of a slobbering Stuart. And he tasted in the language of memory ambered wines, dying <b><font color='red'>fallings</font></b> of sweet airs, the proud pavan, and saw with the eyes of memory kind gentlewomen in Covent Garden wooing from their balconies with sucking mouths and the pox-fouled wenches of the taverns and young wives that, gaily yielding to their ravishers, clipped and clipped again.</p><hr>
<p>A louse crawled over the nape of his neck and, putting his thumb and forefinger deftly beneath his loose collar, he caught it. He rolled its body, tender yet brittle as a grain of rice, between thumb and finger for an instant before he let it <b><font color='red'>fall</font></b> from him and wondered would it live or die. There came to his mind a curious phrase from CORNELIUSA LAPIDE which said that the lice born of human sweat were not created by God with the other animals on the sixth day. But the tickling of the skin of his neck made his mind raw and red. The life of his body, ill clad, ill fed, louse-eaten, made him close his eyelids in a sudden spasm of despair and in the <b><font color='blue'>darkness</font></b> he saw the brittle bright bodies of lice <b><font color='red'>falling</font></b> from the air and turning often as they fell. Yes, and it was not <b><font color='blue'>darkness</font></b> that fell from the air. It was brightness.</p><hr>
<p> He came back quickly along the colonnade towards the group of students. Well then, let her go and be damned to her! She could love some <b><font color='red'>clean</font></b> athlete who washed himself every morning to the waist and had <b><font color='blue'>black</font></b> hair on his chest. Let her.</p><hr>
<p> The soft beauty of the Latin word touched with an enchanting touch the <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> of the evening, with a touch <b><font color='red'>fainter</font></b> and more persuading than the touch of music or of a woman's hand. The strife of their minds was quelled. The figure of a woman as she appears in the liturgy of the church passed silently through the <b><font color='blue'>darkness</font></b>: a white-robed figure, small and slender as a boy, and with a <b><font color='red'>falling</font></b> girdle. Her voice, frail and high as a boy's, was heard intoning from a distant choir the first words of a woman which pierce the gloom and clamour of the first chanting of the passion:</p><hr>
<p> APRIL 10. <b><font color='red'>Faintly</font></b>, under the heavy <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b>, through the silence of the city which has turned from dreams to dreamless sleep as a weary lover whom no caresses move, the sound of hoofs upon the road. Not so <b><font color='red'>faintly</font></b> now as they come near the bridge; and in a moment, as they pass the <b><font color='blue'>darkened</font></b> windows, the silence is cloven by alarm as by an arrow. They are heard now far away, hoofs that shine amid the heavy <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b> as gems, hurrying beyond the sleeping fields to what journey's endâ €” what heart?â €” bearing what tidings?</p><hr>
