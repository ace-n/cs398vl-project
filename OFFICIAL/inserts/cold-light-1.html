<p> It would be better to be in the study hall than out there in the <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b>. The sky was pale and <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> but there were <b><font color='red'>lights</font></b> in the castle. He wondered from which window Hamilton Rowan had thrown his hat on the ha-ha and had there been flowerbeds at that time under the windows. One day when he had been called to the castle the butler had shown him the marks of the soldiers'slugs in the wood of the door and had given him a piece of shortbread that the community ate. It was nice and warm to see the <b><font color='red'>lights</font></b> in the castle. It was like something in a book. Perhaps Leicester Abbey was like that. And there were nice sentences in Doctor Cornwell's Spelling Book. They were like poetry but they were only sentences to learn the spelling from.</p><hr>
<p> He blessed himself and climbed quickly into bed and, tucking the end of the nightshirt under his feet, curled himself together under the <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> white sheets, shaking and trembling. But he would not go to hell when he died; and the shaking would stop.A voice bade the boys in the dormitory good night. He peered out for an instant over the coverlet and saw the yellow curtains round and before his bed that shut him off on all sides. The <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> was lowered quietly.</p><hr>
<p> He looked at Athy's rolled-up sleeves and knuckly inky hands. He had rolled up his sleeves to show how Mr Gleeson would roll up his sleeves. But Mr Gleeson had round shiny cuffs and <b><font color='red'>clean</font></b> white wrists and fattish white hands and the nails of them were long and pointed. Perhaps he pared them too like Lady Boyle. But they were terribly long and pointed nails. So long and cruel they were, though the white fattish hands were not cruel but gentle. And though he trembled with <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> and fright to think of the cruel long nails and of the high whistling sound of the cane and of the chill you felt at the end of your shirt when you undressed yourself yet he felt a feeling of queer quiet pleasure inside him to think of the white fattish hands, <b><font color='red'>clean</font></b> and strong and gentle. And he thought of what Cecil Thunder had said: that Mr Gleeson would not flog Corrigan hard. And Fleming had said he would not because it was best of his play not to. But that was not why</p><hr>
