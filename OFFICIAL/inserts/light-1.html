<p> The wide playgrounds were swarming with boys. All were shouting and the prefects urged them on with strong cries. The evening air was pale and chilly and after every charge and thud of the footballers the greasy leather orb flew like a heavy bird through the grey <b><font color='red'>light</font></b>. He kept on the fringe of his line, out of sight of his prefect, out of the reach of the rude feet, feigning to run now and then. He felt his body small and weak amid the throng of the players and his eyes were weak and watery. Rody Kickham was not like that: he would be captain of the third line all the fellows said.</p><hr>
<p> It would be better to be in the study hall than out there in the cold. The sky was pale and cold but there were <b><font color='red'>lights</font></b> in the castle. He wondered from which window Hamilton Rowan had thrown his hat on the ha-ha and had there been flowerbeds at that time under the windows. One day when he had been called to the castle the butler had shown him the marks of the soldiers'slugs in the wood of the door and had given him a piece of shortbread that the community ate. It was nice and warm to see the <b><font color='red'>lights</font></b> in the castle. It was like something in a book. Perhaps Leicester Abbey was like that. And there were nice sentences in Doctor Cornwell's Spelling Book. They were like poetry but they were only sentences to learn the spelling from.</p><hr>
<p> And the air in the corridor chilled him too. It was queer and wettish. But soon the gas would be lit and in burning it made a <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> noise like a little song. Always the same: and when the fellows stopped talking in the playroom you could hear it.</p><hr>
<p> He blessed himself and climbed quickly into bed and, tucking the end of the nightshirt under his feet, curled himself together under the cold white sheets, shaking and trembling. But he would not go to hell when he died; and the shaking would stop.A voice bade the boys in the dormitory good night. He peered out for an instant over the coverlet and saw the yellow curtains round and before his bed that shut him off on all sides. The <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> was lowered quietly.</p><hr>
<p> The face and the voice went away. Sorry because he was afraid. Afraid that it was some disease. Canker was a disease of plants and cancer one of animals: or another different. That was a long time ago then out on the playgrounds in the evening <b><font color='red'>light</font></b>, creeping from point to point on the fringe of his line, a heavy bird flying low through the grey <b><font color='red'>light</font></b>. Leicester Abbey lit up. Wolsey died there. The abbots buried him themselves.</p><hr>
<p> He looked at the window and saw that the daylight had grown weaker. There would be cloudy grey <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> over the playgrounds. There was no noise on the playgrounds. The class must be doing the themes or perhaps Father Arnall was reading out of the book.</p><hr>
<p> How pale the <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> was at the window! But that was nice. The fire rose and fell on the wall. It was like waves. Someone had put coal on and he heard voices. They were talking. It was the noise of the waves. Or the waves were talking among themselves as they rose and fell.</p><hr>
<p> He saw the sea of waves, long dark waves rising and <b><font color='red'>falling</font></b>, dark under the moonless night.A tiny <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> twinkled at the pierhead where the ship was entering: and he saw a multitude of people gathered by the waters'edge to see the ship that was entering their harbour.A tall man stood on the deck, looking out towards the flat dark land: and by the <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> at the pierhead he saw his face, the sorrowful face of Brother Michael.</p><hr>
<p> All were waiting: uncle Charles, who sat far away in the shadow of the window, Dante and Mr Casey, who sat in the <b><font color='red'>easy</font></b>-chairs at either side of the hearth, Stephen, seated on a chair between them, his feet resting on the toasted boss. Mr Dedalus looked at himself in the pierglass above the mantelpiece, waxed out his moustache ends and then, parting his coat-tails, stood with his back to the glowing fire: and still from time to time he withdrew a hand from his coat-tail to wax out one of his moustache ends. Mr Casey leaned his head to one side and, smiling, tapped the gland of his neck with his fingers. And Stephen smiled too for he knew now that it was not true that Mr Casey had a purse of silver in his throat. He smiled to think how the silvery noise which Mr Casey used to make had deceived him. And when he had tried to open Mr Casey's hand to see if the purse of silver was hidden there he had seen that the fingers could not be straightened out: and Mr Casey had told him that he had got those three cramped fingers making a birthday present for Queen Victoria. Mr Casey tapped the gland of his neck and smiled at Stephen with sleepy eyes: and Mr Dedalus said to him:</p><hr>
<p> Stephen looked with affection at Mr Casey's face which stared across the table over his joined hands. He liked to sit near him at the fire, looking up at his dark fierce face. But his dark eyes were never fierce and his slow voice was good to listen to. But why was he then against the priests? Because Dante must be right then. But he had heard his father say that she was a spoiled nun and that she had come out of the convent in the Alleghanies when her brother had got the money from the savages for the trinkets and the chainies. Perhaps that made her severe against Parnell. And she did not like him to play with Eileen because Eileen was a protestant and when she was young she knew children that used to play with protestants and the protestants used to make fun of the litany of the Blessed Virgin. TOWER OF IVORY, they used to say, HOUSE OF GOLD! How could a woman be a tower of ivory or a house of gold? Who was right then? And he remembered the evening in the infirmary in Clongowes, the dark waters, the <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> at the pierhead and the moan of sorrow from the people when they had heard.</p><hr>
<p> Dante shoved her chair violently aside and left the table, upsetting her napkin-ring which rolled slowly along the carpet and came to rest against the foot of an <b><font color='red'>easy</font></b>-chair. Mrs Dedalus rose quickly and followed her towards the door. At the door Dante turned round violently and shouted down the room, her cheeks flushed and quivering with rage:</p><hr>
<p> The fellows all were silent. Stephen stood among them, afraid to speak, listening.A <b><font color='red'>faint</font></b> sickness of awe made him feel weak. How could they have done that? He thought of the dark silent sacristy. There were dark wooden presses there where the crimped surplices lay quietly folded. It was not the chapel but still you had to speak under your breath. It was a holy place. He remembered the summer evening he had been there to be dressed as boatbearer, the evening of the Procession to the little altar in the wood.A strange and holy place. The boy that held the censer had swung it lifted by the middle chain to keep the coals <b><font color='red'>lighting</font></b>. That was called charcoal: and it had burned quietly as the fellow had swung it gently and had given off a weak sour smell. And then when all were vested he had stood holding out the boat to the rector and the rector had put a spoonful of incense in it and it had hissed on the red coals.</p><hr>
<p> The fellows were talking together in little groups here and there on the playground. The fellows seemed to him to have grown smaller: that was because a sprinter had knocked him down the day before, a fellow out of second of grammar. He had been thrown by the fellow's machine <b><font color='red'>lightly</font></b> on the cinder path and his spectacles had been broken in three pieces and some of the grit of the cinders had gone into his mouth.</p><hr>
<p> That was why the fellows seemed to him smaller and farther away and the goalposts so thin and far and the soft grey sky so high up. But there was no play on the football grounds for cricket was coming: and some said that Barnes would be prof and some said it would be Flowers. And all over the playgrounds they were playing rounders and bowling twisters and lobs. And from here and from there came the sounds of the cricket bats through the soft grey air. They said: pick, pack, pock, puck: little drops of water in a fountain slowly <b><font color='red'>falling</font></b> in the brimming bowl.</p><hr>
<p> He looked at Athy's rolled-up sleeves and knuckly inky hands. He had rolled up his sleeves to show how Mr Gleeson would roll up his sleeves. But Mr Gleeson had round shiny cuffs and <b><font color='red'>clean</font></b> white wrists and fattish white hands and the nails of them were long and pointed. Perhaps he pared them too like Lady Boyle. But they were terribly long and pointed nails. So long and cruel they were, though the white fattish hands were not cruel but gentle. And though he trembled with cold and fright to think of the cruel long nails and of the high whistling sound of the cane and of the chill you felt at the end of your shirt when you undressed yourself yet he felt a feeling of queer quiet pleasure inside him to think of the white fattish hands, <b><font color='red'>clean</font></b> and strong and gentle. And he thought of what Cecil Thunder had said: that Mr Gleeson would not flog Corrigan hard. And Fleming had said he would not because it was best of his play not to. But that was not why</p><hr>
<p> But Mr Harford was very decent and never got into a wax. All the other masters got into dreadful waxes. But why were they to suffer for what fellows in the higher line did? Wells had said that they had drunk some of the altar wine out of the press in the sacristy and that it had been found out who had done it by the smell. Perhaps they had stolen a monstrance to run away with and sell it somewhere. That must have been a terrible sin, to go in there quietly at night, to open the dark press and steal the flashing gold thing into which God was put on the altar in the middle of flowers and candles at benediction while the incense went up in clouds at both sides as the fellow swung the censer and Dominic Kelly sang the first part by himself in the choir. But God was not in it of course when they stole it. But still it was a strange and a great sin even to touch it. He thought of it with deep awe; a terrible and strange sin: it thrilled him to think of it in the silence when the pens scraped <b><font color='red'>lightly</font></b>. But to drink the altar wine out of the press and be found out by the smell was a sin too: but it was not terrible and strange. It only made you feel a little sickish on account of the smell of the wine. Because on the day when he had made his first holy communion in the chapel he had shut his eyes and opened his mouth and put out his tongue a little: and when the rector had stooped down to give him the holy communion he had smelt a <b><font color='red'>faint</font></b> winy smell off the rector's breath after the wine of the mass. The word was beautiful: wine. It made you think of dark purple because the grapes were dark purple that grew in Greece outside houses like white temples. But the <b><font color='red'>faint</font></b> smell of the rector's breath had made him feel a sick feeling on the morning of his first communion. The day of your first communion was the happiest day of your life. And once a lot of generals had asked Napoleon what was the happiest day of his life. They thought he would say the day he won some great battle or the day he was made an emperor. But he said:</p><hr>
<p> Was that a sin for Father Arnall to be in a wax or was he allowed to get into a wax when the boys were <b><font color='red'>idle</font></b> because that made them study better or was he only letting on to be in a wax? It was because he was allowed, because a priest would know what a sin was and would not do it. But if he did it one time by mistake what would he do to go to confession? Perhaps he would go to confession to the minister. And if the minister did it he would go to the rector: and the rector to the provincial: and the provincial to the general of the jesuits. That was called the order: and he had heard his father say that they were all clever men. They could all have become high-up people in the world if they had not become jesuits. And he wondered what Father Arnall and Paddy Barrett would have become and what Mr McGlade and Mr Gleeson would have become if they had not become jesuits. It was hard to think what because you would have to think of them in a different way with different coloured coats and trousers and with beards and moustaches and different kinds of hats.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Any boys want flogging here, Father Arnall? cried the prefect of studies. Any lazy <b><font color='red'>idle</font></b> loafers that want flogging in this class?</p><hr>
<p>â €” Hoho, Fleming! An <b><font color='red'>idler</font></b> of course.I can see it in your eye. Why is he on his knees, Father Arnall?</p><hr>
<p>â €” Of course he did! cried the prefect of studies, of course he did!A born <b><font color='red'>idler</font></b>!I can see it in the corner of his eye.</p><hr>
<p>â €” At your work, all of you! shouted the prefect of studies. We want no lazy <b><font color='red'>idle</font></b> loafers here, lazy <b><font color='red'>idle</font></b> little schemers. At your work,I tell you. Father Dolan will be in to see you every day. Father Dolan will be in tomorrow.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Lazy <b><font color='red'>idle</font></b> little loafer! cried the prefect of studies. Broke my glasses! An old schoolboy trick! Out with your hand this moment!</p><hr>
<p> Stephen drew back his maimed and quivering right arm and held out his left hand. The soutane sleeve swished again as the pandybat was lifted and a loud crashing sound and a fierce maddening tingling burning pain made his hand shrink together with the palms and fingers in a livid quivering mass. The scalding water burst forth from his eyes and, burning with shame and agony and fear, he drew back his shaking arm in terror and burst out into a whine of pain. His body shook with a palsy of fright and in shame and rage he felt the scalding cry come from his throat and the scalding tears <b><font color='red'>falling</font></b> out of his eyes and down his flaming cheeks.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Get at your work, all of you, cried the prefect of studies from the door. Father Dolan will be in every day to see if any boy, any lazy <b><font color='red'>idle</font></b> little loafer wants flogging. Every day. Every day.</p><hr>
<p> It was <b><font color='red'>easy</font></b> what he had to do. All he had to do was when the dinner was over and he came out in his turn to go on walking but not out to the corridor but up the staircase on the right that led to the castle. He had nothing to do but that: to turn to the right and walk fast up the staircase and in half a minute he would be in the low dark narrow corridor that led through the castle to the rector's room. And every fellow had said that it was unfair, even the fellow out of second of grammar who had said that about the senate and the Roman people.</p><hr>
<p> The fellows were practising long shies and bowling lobs and slow twisters. In the soft grey silence he could hear the bump of the balls: and from here and from there through the quiet air the sound of the cricket bats: pick, pack, pock, puck: like drops of water in a fountain <b><font color='red'>falling</font></b> softly in the brimming bowl.</p><hr>
