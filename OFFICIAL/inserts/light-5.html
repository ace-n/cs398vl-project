<p> He shook the sound out of his ears by an angry toss of his head and hurried on, stumbling through the mouldering offal, his heart already bitten by an ache of loathing and bitterness. His father's whistle, his mother's mutterings, the screech of an unseen maniac were to him now so many voices offending and threatening to humble the pride of his youth. He drove their echoes even out of his heart with an execration; but, as he walked down the avenue and felt the grey morning <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> <b><font color='red'>falling</font></b> about him through the dripping trees and smelt the strange wild smell of the wet leaves and bark, his soul was loosed of her miseries.</p><hr>
<p> The rain-laden trees of the avenue evoked in him, as always, memories of the girls and women in the plays of Gerhart Hauptmann; and the memory of their pale sorrows and the fragrance <b><font color='red'>falling</font></b> from the wet branches mingled in a mood of quiet joy. His morning walk across the city had begun, and he foreknew that as he passed the sloblands of Fairview he would think of the cloistral silver-veined prose of Newman; that as he walked along the North Strand Road, glancing idly at the windows of the provision shops, he would recall the dark humour of Guido Cavalcanti and smile; that as he went by Baird's stonecutting works in Talbot Place the spirit of Ibsen would blow through him like a keen wind, a spirit of wayward boyish beauty; and that passing a grimy marine dealer's shop beyond the Liffey he would repeat the song by Ben Jonson which begins:</p><hr>
<p> The lore which he was believed to pass his days brooding upon so that it had rapt him from the companionship of youth was only a garner of slender sentences from Aristotle's poetics and psychology and a SYNOPSIS PHILOSOPHIAE SCHOLASTICAE AD MENTEM DIVI THOMAE. His thinking was a dusk of doubt and self-mistrust, lit up at moments by the lightnings of intuition, but lightnings of so clear a splendour that in those moments the world perished about his feet as if it had been fire-consumed; and thereafter his tongue grew heavy and he met the eyes of others with unanswering eyes, for he felt that the spirit of beauty had folded him round like a mantle and that in revery at least he had been acquainted with nobility. But when this brief pride of silence upheld him no longer he was glad to find himself still in the midst of common lives, passing on his way amid the squalor and noise and sloth of the city fearlessly and with a <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> heart.</p><hr>
<p> Eleven! Then he was late for that lecture too. What day of the week was it? He stopped at a newsagent's to read the headline of a placard. Thursday. Ten to eleven, English; eleven to twelve, French; twelve to one, physics. He fancied to himself the English lecture and felt, even at that distance, restless and helpless. He saw the heads of his classmates meekly bent as they wrote in their notebooks the points they were bidden to note, nominal definitions, essential definitions and examples or dates of birth or death, chief works, a favourable and an unfavourable criticism side by side. His own head was unbent for his thoughts wandered abroad and whether he looked around the little class of students or out of the window across the desolate gardens of the green an odour assailed him of cheerless cellar-damp and decay. Another head than his, right before him in the first benches, was poised squarely above its bending fellows like the head of a priest appealing without humility to the tabernacle for the humble worshippers about him. Why was it that when he thought of Cranly he could never raise before his mind the entire image of his body but only the image of the head and face? Even now against the grey curtain of the morning he saw it before him like the phantom of a dream, the face of a severed head or death-mask, crowned on the brows by its stiff black upright hair as by an iron crown. It was a priest-like face, priest-like in its palor, in the wide winged nose, in the shadowings below the eyes and along the jaws, priest-like in the lips that were long and bloodless and <b><font color='red'>faintly</font></b> smiling; and Stephen, remembering swiftly how he had told Cranly of all the tumults and unrest and longings in his soul, day after day and night by night, only to be answered by his friend's listening silence, would have told himself that it was the face of a guilty priest who heard confessions of those whom he had not power to absolve but that he felt again in memory the gaze of its dark womanish eyes.</p><hr>
<p> He looked at it without anger; for, though sloth of the body and of the soul crept over it like unseen vermin, over the shuffling feet and up the folds of the cloak and around the servile head, it seemed humbly conscious of its indignity. It was a Firbolg in the borrowed cloak of a Milesian; and he thought of his friend Davin, the peasant student. It was a jesting name between them, but the young peasant bore with it <b><font color='red'>lightly</font></b>:</p><hr>
<p> Side by side with his memory of the deeds of prowess of his uncle Mat Davin, the athlete, the young peasant worshipped the sorrowful legend of Ireland. The gossip of his fellow-students which strove to render the flat life of the college significant at any cost loved to think of him as a young fenian. His nurse had taught him Irish and shaped his rude imagination by the broken <b><font color='red'>lights</font></b> of Irish myth. He stood towards the myth upon which no individual mind had ever drawn out a line of beauty and to its unwieldy tales that divided against themselves as they moved down the cycles in the same attitude as towards the Roman catholic religion, the attitude of a dull-witted loyal serf. Whatsoever of thought or of feeling came to him from England or by way of English culture his mind stood armed against in obedience to a password; and of the world that lay beyond England he knew only the foreign legion of France in which he spoke of serving.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Well,I suppose that doesn't interest you, but leastways there was such noise after the match thatI missed the train home andI couldn't get any kind of a yoke to give me a lift for, as luck would have it, there was a mass meeting that same day over in Castletownroche and all the cars in the country were there. So there was nothing for it only to stay the night or to foot it out. Well,I started to walk and onI went and it was coming on night whenI got into the Ballyhoura hills, that's better than ten miles from Kilmallock and there's a long lonely road after that. You wouldn't see the sign of a christian house along the road or hear a sound. It was pitch dark almost. Once or twiceI stopped by the way under a bush to redden my pipe and only for the dew was thickI'd have stretched out there and slept. At last, after a bend of the road,I spied a little cottage with a <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> in the window.I went up and knocked at the door.A voice asked who was there andI answeredI was over at the match in Buttevant and was walking back and thatI'd be thankful for a glass of water. After a while a young woman opened the door and brought me out a big mug of milk. She was half undressed as if she was going to bed whenI knocked and she had her hair hanging andI thought by her figure and by something in the look of her eyes that she must be carrying a child. She kept me in talk a long while at the door, andI thought it strange because her breast and her shoulders were bare. She asked me wasI tired and wouldI like to stop the night there. She said she was all alone in the house and that her husband had gone that morning to Queenstown with his sister to see her off. And all the time she was talking, Stevie, she had her eyes fixed on my face and she stood so close to meI could hear her breathing. WhenI handed her back the mug at last she took my hand to draw me in over the threshold and said:'COME IN AND STAY THE NIGHT HERE. YOU'VE NO CALL TO BE FRIGHTENED. THERE'S NO ONE IN IT BUT OURSELVES ...'I didn't go in, Stevie.I thanked her and went on my way again, all in a fever. At the first bend of the roadI looked back and she was standing at the door.</p><hr>
<p> But the trees in Stephen's Green were fragrant of rain and the rain-sodden earth gave forth its mortal odour, a <b><font color='red'>faint</font></b> incense rising upward through the mould from many hearts. The soul of the gallant venal city which his elders had told him of had shrunk with time to a <b><font color='red'>faint</font></b> mortal odour rising from the earth and he knew that in a moment when he entered the sombre college he would be conscious of a corruption other than that of Buck Egan and Burnchapel Whaley.</p><hr>
<p> He opened the door of the theatre and halted in the chilly grey <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> that struggled through the dusty windows.A figure was crouching before the large grate and by its leanness and greyness he knew that it was the dean of studies <b><font color='red'>lighting</font></b> the fire. Stephen closed the door quietly and approached the fireplace.</p><hr>
<p>â €” One moment now, Mr Dedalus, and you will see. There is an art in <b><font color='red'>lighting</font></b> a fire. We have the liberal arts and we have the useful arts. This is one of the useful arts.</p><hr>
<p> He produced four candle-butts from the side-pockets of his soutane and placed them deftly among the coals and twisted papers. Stephen watched him in silence. Kneeling thus on the flagstone to kindle the fire and busied with the disposition of his wisps of paper and candle-butts he seemed more than ever a humble server making ready the place of sacrifice in an empty temple, a levite of the Lord. Like a levite's robe of plain linen the faded worn soutane draped the kneeling figure of one whom the canonicals or the bell-bordered ephod would irk and trouble. His very body had waxed old in lowly service of the Lordâ €” in tending the fire upon the altar, in bearing tidings secretly, in waiting upon worldlings, in striking swiftly when biddenâ €” and yet had remained ungraced by aught of saintly or of prelatic beauty. Nay, his very soul had waxed old in that service without growing towards <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> and beauty or spreading abroad a sweet odour of her sanctityâ €” a mortified will no more responsive to the thrill of its obedience than was to the thrill of love or combat his ageing body, spare and sinewy, greyed with a silver-pointed down.</p><hr>
<p>â €”I am sureI could not <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> a fire.</p><hr>
<p>â €” For my purposeI can work on at present by the <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> of one or two ideas of Aristotle and Aquinas.</p><hr>
<p>â €”I need them only for my own use and guidance untilI have done something for myself by their <b><font color='red'>light</font></b>. If the lamp smokes or smellsI shall try to trim it. If it does not give <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> enoughI shall sell it and buy another.</p><hr>
<p> Leaning against the fireplace Stephen heard him greet briskly and impartially every student of the class and could almost see the frank smiles of the coarser students.A desolating pity began to <b><font color='red'>fall</font></b> like dew upon his <b><font color='red'>easily</font></b> embittered heart for this faithful serving-man of the knightly Loyola, for this half-brother of the clergy, more venal than they in speech, more steadfast of soul than they, one whom he would never call his ghostly father; and he thought how this man and his companions had earned the name of worldlings at the hands not of the unworldly only but of the worldly also for having pleaded, during all their history, at the bar of God's justice for the souls of the lax and the lukewarm and the prudent.</p><hr>
<p> Stephen glanced up quickly but Moynihan's snoutish face, outlined on the grey <b><font color='red'>light</font></b>, was impassive.A formula was given out. Amid the rustling of the notebooks Stephen turned back again and said:</p><hr>
<p> Stephen, checked by the crowd at the door, halted irresolutely. From under the wide <b><font color='red'>falling</font></b> leaf of a soft hat Cranly's dark eyes were watching him.</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Easy</font></b>, <b><font color='red'>easy</font></b>, <b><font color='red'>easy</font></b>!</p><hr>
<p> They had reached the canal bridge and, turning from their course, went on by the trees.A crude grey <b><font color='red'>light</font></b>, mirrored in the sluggish water and a smell of wet branches over their heads seemed to war against the course of Stephen's thought.</p><hr>
<p>â €” The connotation of the word, Stephen said, is rather vague. Aquinas uses a term which seems to be inexact. It baffled me for a long time. It would lead you to believe that he had in mind symbolism or idealism, the supreme quality of beauty being a <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> from some other world, the idea of which the matter is but the shadow, the reality of which it is but the symbol.I thought he might mean that CLARITAS is the artistic discovery and representation of the divine purpose in anything or a force of generalization which would make the esthetic image a universal one, make it outshine its proper conditions. But that is literary talk.I understand it so. When you have apprehended that basket as one thing and have then analysed it according to its form and apprehended it as a thing you make the only synthesis which is logically and esthetically permissible. You see that it is that thing which it is and no other thing. The radiance of which he speaks in the scholastic QUIDDITAS, the WHATNESS of a thing. This supreme quality is felt by the artist when the esthetic image is first conceived in his imagination. The mind in that mysterious instant Shelley likened beautifully to a fading coal. The instant wherein that supreme quality of beauty, the clear radiance of the esthetic image, is apprehended luminously by the mind which has been arrested by its wholeness and fascinated by its harmony is the luminous silent stasis of esthetic pleasure, a spiritual state very like to that cardiac condition which the Italian physiologist Luigi Galvani, using a phrase almost as beautiful as Shelley's, called the enchantment of the heart.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Lessing, said Stephen, should not have taken a group of statues to write of. The art, being inferior, does not present the formsI spoke of distinguished clearly one from another. Even in literature, the highest and most spiritual art, the forms are often confused. The lyrical form is in fact the simplest verbal vesture of an instant of emotion, a rhythmical cry such as ages ago cheered on the man who pulled at the oar or dragged stones up a slope. He who utters it is more conscious of the instant of emotion than of himself as feeling emotion. The simplest epical form is seen emerging out of lyrical literature when the artist prolongs and broods upon himself as the centre of an epical event and this form progresses till the centre of emotional gravity is equidistant from the artist himself and from others. The narrative is no longer purely personal. The personality of the artist passes into the narration itself, flowing round and round the persons and the action like a vital sea. This progress you will see <b><font color='red'>easily</font></b> in that old English ballad TURPIN HERO which begins in the first person and ends in the third person. The dramatic form is reached when the vitality which has flowed and eddied round each person fills every person with such vital force that he or she assumes a proper and intangible esthetic life. The personality of the artist, at first a cry or a cadence or a mood and then a fluid and lambent narrative, finally refines itself out of existence, impersonalizes itself, so to speak. The esthetic image in the dramatic form is life purified in and reprojected from the human imagination. The mystery of esthetic, like that of material creation, is accomplished. The artist, like the God of creation, remains within or behind or beyond or above his handiwork, invisible, refined out of existence, indifferent, paring his fingernails.</p><hr>
<p>A fine rain began to <b><font color='red'>fall</font></b> from the high veiled sky and they turned into the duke's lawn to reach the national library before the shower came.</p><hr>
<p> The quick <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> shower had drawn off, tarrying in clusters of diamonds among the shrubs of the quadrangle where an exhalation was breathed forth by the blackened earth. Their trim boots prattled as they stood on the steps of the colonnade, talking quietly and gaily, glancing at the clouds, holding their umbrellas at cunning angles against the few last raindrops, closing them again, holding their skirts demurely.</p><hr>
<p> Towards dawn he awoke.O what sweet music! His soul was all dewy wet. Over his limbs in sleep pale cool waves of <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> had passed. He lay still, as if his soul lay amid cool waters, conscious of <b><font color='red'>faint</font></b> sweet music. His mind was waking slowly to a tremulous morning knowledge, a morning inspiration.A spirit filled him, pure as the purest water, sweet as dew, moving as music. But how <b><font color='red'>faintly</font></b> it was inbreathed, how passionlessly, as if the seraphim themselves were breathing upon him! His soul was waking slowly, fearing to awake wholly. It was that windless hour of dawn when madness wakes and strange plants open to the <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> and the moth flies forth silently.</p><hr>
<p> The instant of inspiration seemed now to be reflected from all sides at once from a multitude of cloudy circumstances of what had happened or of what might have happened. The instant flashed forth like a point of <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> and now from cloud on cloud of vague circumstance confused form was veiling softly its afterglow.O! In the virgin womb of the imagination the word was made flesh. Gabriel the seraph had come to the virgin's chamber. An afterglow deepened within his spirit, whence the white flame had passed, deepening to a rose and ardent <b><font color='red'>light</font></b>. That rose and ardent <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> was her strange wilful heart, strange that no man had known or would know, wilful from before the beginning of the world; and lured by that ardent rose-like glow the choirs of the seraphim were <b><font color='red'>falling</font></b> from heaven.</p><hr>
<p> Are you not weary of ardent ways, Lure of the <b><font color='red'>fallen</font></b> seraphim? Tell no more of enchanted days. The verses passed from his mind to his lips and, murmuring them over, he felt the rhythmic movement of a villanelle pass through them. The rose-like glow sent forth its rays of rhyme; ways, days, blaze, praise, raise. Its rays burned up the world, consumed the hearts of men and angels: the rays from the rose that was her wilful heart.</p><hr>
<p> Above the flame the smoke of praise Goes up from ocean rim to rim Tell no more of enchanted days. Smoke went up from the whole earth, from the vapoury oceans, smoke of her praise. The earth was like a swinging swaying censer, a ball of incense, an ellipsoidal <b><font color='red'>fall</font></b>. The rhythm died out at once; the cry of his heart was broken. His lips began to murmur the first verses over and over; then went on stumbling through half verses, stammering and baffled; then stopped. The heart's cry was broken.</p><hr>
<p> The veiled windless hour had passed and behind the panes of the naked window the morning <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> was gathering.A bell beat <b><font color='red'>faintly</font></b> very far away.A bird twittered; two birds, three. The bell and the bird ceased; and the dull white <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> spread itself east and west, covering the world, covering the roselight in his heart.</p><hr>
<p> At certain instants her eyes seemed about to trust him but he had waited in vain. She passed now dancing <b><font color='red'>lightly</font></b> across his memory as she had been that night at the carnival ball, her white dress a little lifted, a white spray nodding in her hair. She danced <b><font color='red'>lightly</font></b> in the round. She was dancing towards him and, as she came, her eyes were a little averted and a <b><font color='red'>faint</font></b> glow was on her cheek. At the pause in the chain of hands her hand had lain in his an instant, a soft merchandise.</p><hr>
<p> For answer she had danced away from him along the chain of hands, dancing <b><font color='red'>lightly</font></b> and discreetly, giving herself to none. The white spray nodded to her dancing and when she was in shadow the glow was deeper on her cheek.</p><hr>
<p> The full morning <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> had come. No sound was to be heard; but he knew that all around him life was about to awaken in common noises, hoarse voices, sleepy prayers. Shrinking from that life he turned towards the wall, making a cowl of the blanket and staring at the great overblown scarlet flowers of the tattered wallpaper. He tried to warm his perishing joy in their scarlet glow, imagining a roseway from where he lay upwards to heaven all strewn with scarlet flowers. Weary! Weary! He too was weary of ardent ways.</p><hr>
<p> He had written verses for her again after ten years. Ten years before she had worn her shawl cowlwise about her head, sending sprays of her warm breath into the night air, tapping her foot upon the glassy road. It was the last tram; the lank brown horses knew it and shook their bells to the clear night in admonition. The conductor talked with the driver, both nodding often in the green <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> of the lamp. They stood on the steps of the tram, he on the upper, she on the lower. She came up to his step many times between their phrases and went down again and once or twice remained beside him forgetting to go down and then went down. Let be! Let be!</p><hr>
<p> Are you not weary of ardent ways, Lure of the <b><font color='red'>fallen</font></b> seraphim? Tell no more of enchanted days. Your eyes have set man's heart ablaze And you have had your will of him. Are you not weary of ardent ways? Above the flame the smoke of praise Goes up from ocean rim to rim. Tell no more of enchanted days. Our broken cries and mournful lays Rise in one eucharistic hymn. Are you not weary of ardent ways? While sacrificing hands upraise The chalice flowing to the brim. Tell no more of enchanted days. And still you hold our longing gaze With languorous look and lavish limb! Are you not weary of ardent ways? Tell no more of enchanted days.</p><hr>
<p> He listened to the cries: like the squeak of mice behind the wainscot: a shrill twofold note. But the notes were long and shrill and whirring, unlike the cry of vermin, <b><font color='red'>falling</font></b> a third or a fourth and trilled as the flying beaks clove the air. Their cry was shrill and clear and fine and <b><font color='red'>falling</font></b> like threads of silken <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> unwound from whirring spools.</p><hr>
<p> He had a quiet toneless voice and urbane manners and on a finger of his plump <b><font color='red'>clean</font></b> hand he displayed at moments a signet ring.</p><hr>
<p> The park trees were heavy with rain; and rain fell still and ever in the lake, lying grey like a shield.A game of swans flew there and the water and the shore beneath were fouled with their green-white slime. They embraced softly, impelled by the grey rainy <b><font color='red'>light</font></b>, the wet silent trees, the shield-like witnessing lake, the swans. They embraced without joy or passion, his arm about his sister's neck.A grey woollen cloak was wrapped athwart her from her shoulder to her waist and her fair head was bent in willing shame. He had loose red-brown hair and tender shapely strong freckled hands. Face? There was no face seen. The brother's face was bent upon her fair rain-fragrant hair. The hand freckled and strong and shapely and caressing was Davin's hand.</p><hr>
<p> Dixon patted him <b><font color='red'>lightly</font></b> on the shoulder and said mildly:</p><hr>
<p> She passed out from the porch of the library and bowed across Stephen in reply to Cranly's greeting. He also? Was there not a slight flush on Cranly's cheek? Or had it come forth at Temple's words? The <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> had waned. He could not see.</p><hr>
<p> He began to beat the frayed end of his ashplant against the base of a pillar. Had Cranly not heard him? Yet he could wait. The talk about him ceased for a moment and a soft hiss fell again from a window above. But no other sound was in the air and the swallows whose flight he had followed with <b><font color='red'>idle</font></b> eyes were sleeping.</p><hr>
<p> She had passed through the dusk. And therefore the air was silent save for one soft hiss that fell. And therefore the tongues about him had ceased their babble. Darkness was <b><font color='red'>falling</font></b>.</p><hr>
<p> Darkness <b><font color='red'>falls</font></b> from the air.A trembling joy, lambent as a <b><font color='red'>faint</font></b> <b><font color='red'>light</font></b>, played like a fairy host around him. But why? Her passage through the darkening air or the verse with its black vowels and its opening sound, rich and lutelike?</p><hr>
<p> Eyes, opening from the darkness of desire, eyes that dimmed the breaking east. What was their languid grace but the softness of chambering? And what was their shimmer but the shimmer of the scum that mantled the cesspool of the court of a slobbering Stuart. And he tasted in the language of memory ambered wines, dying <b><font color='red'>fallings</font></b> of sweet airs, the proud pavan, and saw with the eyes of memory kind gentlewomen in Covent Garden wooing from their balconies with sucking mouths and the pox-fouled wenches of the taverns and young wives that, gaily yielding to their ravishers, clipped and clipped again.</p><hr>
<p>A louse crawled over the nape of his neck and, putting his thumb and forefinger deftly beneath his loose collar, he caught it. He rolled its body, tender yet brittle as a grain of rice, between thumb and finger for an instant before he let it <b><font color='red'>fall</font></b> from him and wondered would it live or die. There came to his mind a curious phrase from CORNELIUSA LAPIDE which said that the lice born of human sweat were not created by God with the other animals on the sixth day. But the tickling of the skin of his neck made his mind raw and red. The life of his body, ill clad, ill fed, louse-eaten, made him close his eyelids in a sudden spasm of despair and in the darkness he saw the brittle bright bodies of lice <b><font color='red'>falling</font></b> from the air and turning often as they fell. Yes, and it was not darkness that fell from the air. It was brightness.</p><hr>
<p> Brightness <b><font color='red'>falls</font></b> from the air. He had not even remembered rightly Nash's line. All the images it had awakened were false. His mind bred vermin. His thoughts were lice born of the sweat of sloth.</p><hr>
<p> He came back quickly along the colonnade towards the group of students. Well then, let her go and be damned to her! She could love some <b><font color='red'>clean</font></b> athlete who washed himself every morning to the waist and had black hair on his chest. Let her.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Go <b><font color='red'>easy</font></b>, my dear man. You're an excitable bloody man, do you know.</p><hr>
<p> Cranly examined the fig by the <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> of a lamp under which he halted. Then he smelt it with both nostrils, bit a tiny piece, spat it out and threw the fig rudely into the gutter.</p><hr>
<p> They had walked on towards the township of Pembroke and now, as they went on slowly along the avenues, the trees and the scattered <b><font color='red'>lights</font></b> in the villas soothed their minds. The air of wealth and repose diffused about them seemed to comfort their neediness. Behind a hedge of laurel a <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> glimmered in the window of a kitchen and the voice of a servant was heard singing as she sharpened knives. She sang, in short broken bars:</p><hr>
<p> The soft beauty of the Latin word touched with an enchanting touch the dark of the evening, with a touch <b><font color='red'>fainter</font></b> and more persuading than the touch of music or of a woman's hand. The strife of their minds was quelled. The figure of a woman as she appears in the liturgy of the church passed silently through the darkness: a white-robed figure, small and slender as a boy, and with a <b><font color='red'>falling</font></b> girdle. Her voice, frail and high as a boy's, was heard intoning from a distant choir the first words of a woman which pierce the gloom and clamour of the first chanting of the passion:</p><hr>
<p> And all hearts were touched and turned to her voice, shining like a young star, shining clearer as the voice intoned the proparoxytone and more <b><font color='red'>faintly</font></b> as the cadence died.</p><hr>
<p>â €” She's <b><font color='red'>easy</font></b> to find, Cranly said.</p><hr>
<p> He produced his match and began to <b><font color='red'>clean</font></b> the crevice between two teeth. Then he said carelessly:</p><hr>
<p> MARCH 30. This evening Cranly was in the porch of the library, proposing a problem to Dixon and her brother.A mother let her child <b><font color='red'>fall</font></b> into the Nile. Still harping on the mother.A crocodile seized the child. Mother asked it back. Crocodile said all right if she told him what he was going to do with the child, eat it or not eat it.</p><hr>
<p> APRIL2. Saw her drinking tea and eating cakes in Johnston's, Mooney andO'Brien's. Rather, lynx-eyed Lynch saw her as we passed. He tells me Cranly was invited there by brother. Did he bring his crocodile? Is he the shining <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> now? Well,I discovered him.I protestI did. Shining quietly behind a bushel of Wicklow bran.</p><hr>
<p> APRIL 10. <b><font color='red'>Faintly</font></b>, under the heavy night, through the silence of the city which has turned from dreams to dreamless sleep as a weary lover whom no caresses move, the sound of hoofs upon the road. Not so <b><font color='red'>faintly</font></b> now as they come near the bridge; and in a moment, as they pass the darkened windows, the silence is cloven by alarm as by an arrow. They are heard now far away, hoofs that shine amid the heavy night as gems, hurrying beyond the sleeping fields to what journey's endâ €” what heart?â €” bearing what tidings?</p><hr>
