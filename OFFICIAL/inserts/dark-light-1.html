<p> He blessed himself and climbed quickly into bed and, tucking the end of the nightshirt under his feet, curled himself together under the cold white sheets, shaking and trembling. But he would not go to hell when he died; and the shaking would stop.A voice bade the boys in the dormitory good <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b>. He peered out for an instant over the coverlet and saw the yellow curtains round and before his bed that shut him off on all sides. The <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> was lowered quietly.</p><hr>
<p> He saw the sea of waves, long <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> waves rising and <b><font color='red'>falling</font></b>, <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> under the moonless <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b>.A tiny <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> twinkled at the pierhead where the ship was entering: and he saw a multitude of people gathered by the waters'edge to see the ship that was entering their harbour.A tall man stood on the deck, looking out towards the flat <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> land: and by the <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> at the pierhead he saw his face, the sorrowful face of Brother Michael.</p><hr>
<p> Stephen looked with affection at Mr Casey's face which stared across the table over his joined hands. He liked to sit near him at the fire, looking up at his <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> fierce face. But his <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> eyes were never fierce and his slow voice was good to listen to. But why was he then against the priests? Because Dante must be right then. But he had heard his father say that she was a spoiled nun and that she had come out of the convent in the Alleghanies when her brother had got the money from the savages for the trinkets and the chainies. Perhaps that made her severe against Parnell. And she did not like him to play with Eileen because Eileen was a protestant and when she was young she knew children that used to play with protestants and the protestants used to make fun of the litany of the Blessed Virgin. TOWER OF IVORY, they used to say, HOUSE OF GOLD! How could a woman be a tower of ivory or a house of gold? Who was right then? And he remembered the evening in the infirmary in Clongowes, the <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> waters, the <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> at the pierhead and the moan of sorrow from the people when they had heard.</p><hr>
<p> The fellows all were silent. Stephen stood among them, afraid to speak, listening.A <b><font color='red'>faint</font></b> sickness of awe made him feel weak. How could they have done that? He thought of the <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> silent sacristy. There were <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> wooden presses there where the crimped surplices lay quietly folded. It was not the chapel but still you had to speak under your breath. It was a holy place. He remembered the summer evening he had been there to be dressed as boatbearer, the evening of the Procession to the little altar in the wood.A strange and holy place. The boy that held the censer had swung it lifted by the middle chain to keep the coals <b><font color='red'>lighting</font></b>. That was called charcoal: and it had burned quietly as the fellow had swung it gently and had given off a weak sour smell. And then when all were vested he had stood holding out the boat to the rector and the rector had put a spoonful of incense in it and it had hissed on the red coals.</p><hr>
<p> But Mr Harford was very decent and never got into a wax. All the other masters got into dreadful waxes. But why were they to suffer for what fellows in the higher line did? Wells had said that they had drunk some of the altar wine out of the press in the sacristy and that it had been found out who had done it by the smell. Perhaps they had stolen a monstrance to run away with and sell it somewhere. That must have been a terrible sin, to go in there quietly at <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b>, to open the <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> press and steal the flashing gold thing into which God was put on the altar in the middle of flowers and candles at benediction while the incense went up in clouds at both sides as the fellow swung the censer and Dominic Kelly sang the first part by himself in the choir. But God was not in it of course when they stole it. But still it was a strange and a great sin even to touch it. He thought of it with deep awe; a terrible and strange sin: it thrilled him to think of it in the silence when the pens scraped <b><font color='red'>lightly</font></b>. But to drink the altar wine out of the press and be found out by the smell was a sin too: but it was not terrible and strange. It only made you feel a little sickish on account of the smell of the wine. Because on the day when he had made his first holy communion in the chapel he had shut his eyes and opened his mouth and put out his tongue a little: and when the rector had stooped down to give him the holy communion he had smelt a <b><font color='red'>faint</font></b> winy smell off the rector's breath after the wine of the mass. The word was beautiful: wine. It made you think of <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> purple because the grapes were <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> purple that grew in Greece outside houses like white temples. But the <b><font color='red'>faint</font></b> smell of the rector's breath had made him feel a sick feeling on the morning of his first communion. The day of your first communion was the happiest day of your life. And once a lot of generals had asked Napoleon what was the happiest day of his life. They thought he would say the day he won some great battle or the day he was made an emperor. But he said:</p><hr>
<p> It was <b><font color='red'>easy</font></b> what he had to do. All he had to do was when the dinner was over and he came out in his turn to go on walking but not out to the corridor but up the staircase on the right that led to the castle. He had nothing to do but that: to turn to the right and walk fast up the staircase and in half a minute he would be in the low <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> narrow corridor that led through the castle to the rector's room. And every fellow had said that it was unfair, even the fellow out of second of grammar who had said that about the senate and the Roman people.</p><hr>
