<p> Once upon a time and a very <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> time it was there was a moocow coming down along the road and this moocow that was coming down along the road met a nicens little boy named baby tuckoo ...</p><hr>
<p> It would be nice to lie on the hearthrug before the fire, leaning his head upon his hands, and think on those sentences. He shivered as if he had cold slimy water next his skin. That was mean of <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b> to shoulder him into the square ditch because he would not swop his little snuff box for <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b>'s seasoned hacking chestnut, the conqueror of forty. How cold and slimy the water had been!A fellow had once seen a big rat jump into the scum. Mother was sitting at the fire with Dante waiting for Brigid to bring in the tea. She had her feet on the fender and her jewelly slippers were so hot and they had such a lovely warm smell! Dante knew a lot of things. She had taught him where the Mozambique Channel was and what was the longest river in America and what was the name of the highest mountain in the moon. Father Arnall knew more than Dante because he was a priest but both his father and uncle Charles said that Dante was a clever woman and a <b><font color='red'>well</font></b>-read woman. And when Dante made that noise after dinner and then put up her hand to her mouth: that was heartburn.</p><hr>
<p> Stephen tried his best, but the sum was too hard and he felt confused. The little silk badge with the white rose on it that was pinned on the breast of his jacket began to flutter. He was no <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> at sums, but he tried his best so that York might not lose. Father Arnall's face looked very black, but he was not in a wax: he was laughing. Then Jack Lawton cracked his fingers and Father Arnall looked at his copybook and said:</p><hr>
<p> Then he went away from the door and <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b> came over to Stephen and said:</p><hr>
<p> <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b> turned to the other fellows and said:</p><hr>
<p> <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b> said:</p><hr>
<p> They all laughed again. Stephen tried to laugh with them. He felt his whole body hot and confused in a moment. What was the right answer to the question? He had given two and still <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b> laughed. But <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b> must know the right answer for he was in third of grammar. He tried to think of <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b>'s mother but he did not dare to raise his eyes to <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b>'s face. He did not like <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b>'s face. It was <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b> who had shouldered him into the square ditch the day before because he would not swop his little snuff box for <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b>'s seasoned hacking chestnut, the conqueror of forty. It was a mean thing to do; all the fellows said it was. And how cold and slimy the water had been! And a fellow had once seen a big rat jump plop into the scum.</p><hr>
<p> The cold slime of the ditch covered his whole body; and, when the bell rang for study and the lines filed out of the playrooms, he felt the cold air of the corridor and staircase inside his clothes. He still tried to think what was the right answer. Was it right to kiss his mother or wrong to kiss his mother? What did that mean, to kiss? You put your face up like that to say <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> night and then his mother put her face down. That was to kiss. His mother put her lips on his cheek; her lips were soft and they wetted his cheek; and they made a tiny little noise: kiss. Why did people do that with their two faces?</p><hr>
<p> It pained him that he did not know <b><font color='red'>well</font></b> what politics meant and that he did not know where the universe ended. He felt small and weak. When would he be like the fellows in poetry and rhetoric? They had big voices and big boots and they studied trigonometry. That was very far away. First came the vacation and then the next term and then vacation again and then again another term and then again the vacation. It was like a train going in and out of tunnels and that was like the noise of the boys eating in the refectory when you opened and closed the flaps of the ears. Term, vacation; tunnel, out; noise, stop. How far away it was! It was better to go to bed to sleep. Only prayers in the chapel and then bed. He shivered and yawned. It would be lovely in bed after the sheets got a bit hot. First they were so cold to get into. He shivered to think how cold they were first. But then they got hot and then he could sleep. It was lovely to be tired. He yawned again. Night prayers and then bed: he shivered and wanted to yawn. It would be lovely in a few minutes. He felt a warm glow creeping up from the cold shivering sheets, warmer and warmer till he felt warm all over, ever so warm and yet he shivered a little and still wanted to yawn.</p><hr>
<p> He blessed himself and climbed quickly into bed and, tucking the end of the nightshirt under his feet, curled himself together under the cold white sheets, shaking and trembling. But he would not go to hell when he died; and the shaking would stop.A voice bade the boys in the dormitory <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> night. He peered out for an instant over the coverlet and saw the yellow curtains round and before his bed that shut him off on all sides. The light was lowered quietly.</p><hr>
<p> The train was <b><font color='red'>full</font></b> of fellows: a long long chocolate train with cream facings. The guards went to and fro opening, closing, locking, unlocking the doors. They were men in dark blue and silver; they had silvery whistles and their keys made a quick music: click, click: click, click.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Are you not <b><font color='red'>well</font></b>?</p><hr>
<p>â €” Get back into bed.I'll tell McGlade you're not <b><font color='red'>well</font></b>.</p><hr>
<p> <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b>'s face was there. He looked at it and saw that <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b> was afraid.</p><hr>
<p> <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b> said:</p><hr>
<p> It was not <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b>'s face, it was the prefect's. He was not foxing. No, no: he was sick really. He was not foxing. And he felt the prefect's hand on his forehead; and he felt his forehead warm and damp against the prefect's cold damp hand. That was the way a rat felt, slimy and damp and cold. Every rat had two eyes to look out of. Sleek slimy coats, little little feet tucked up to jump, black slimy eyes to look out of. They could understand how to jump. But the minds of rats could not understand trigonometry. When they were dead they lay on their sides. Their coats dried then. They were only dead things.</p><hr>
<p>â €” WillI? the fellow said.I'm not <b><font color='red'>well</font></b> yet.</p><hr>
<p> <b><font color='red'>Dear</font></b> Mother,</p><hr>
<p> How far away they were! There was cold sunlight outside the window. He wondered if he would die. You could die just the same on a sunny day. He might die before his mother came. Then he would have a dead mass in the chapel like the way the fellows had told him it was when Little had died. All the fellows would be at the mass, dressed in black, all with sad faces. <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b> too would be there but no fellow would look at him. The rector would be there in a cope of black and gold and there would be tall yellow candles on the altar and round the catafalque. And they would carry the coffin out of the chapel slowly and he would be buried in the little graveyard of the community off the main avenue of limes. And <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b> would be sorry then for what he had done. And the bell would toll slowly.</p><hr>
<p> Then Brother Michael was going away and the fellow out of the third of grammar told him to be sure and come back and tell him all the news in the paper. He told Stephen that his name was Athy and that his father kept a lot of racehorses that were spiffing jumpers and that his father would give a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> tip to Brother Michael any time he wanted it because Brother Michael was very decent and always told him the news out of the paper they got every day up in the castle. There was every kind of news in the paper: accidents, shipwrecks, sports, and politics.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Are you <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> at riddles?</p><hr>
<p>â €” Not very <b><font color='red'>good</font></b>.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Yes. <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b> now, that's all right.O, we had a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> walk, hadn't we, John? Yes ...I wonder if there's any likelihood of dinner this evening. Yes ...O, <b><font color='red'>well</font></b> now, we got a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> breath of ozone round the Head today. Ay, bedad.</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b>,I can't help thinking of our friend Christopher manufacturing ...</p><hr>
<p> Stephen looked at the plump turkey which had lain, trussed and skewered, on the kitchen table. He knew that his father had paid a guinea for it in Dunn's ofD'Olier Street and that the man had prodded it often at the breastbone to show how <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> it was: and he remembered the man's voice when he had said:</p><hr>
<p> He poured sauce freely over Stephen's plate and set the boat again on the table. Then he asked uncle Charles was it tender. Uncle Charles could not speak because his mouth was <b><font color='red'>full</font></b>; but he nodded that it was.</p><hr>
<p>â €” That was a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> answer our friend made to the canon. What? said Mr Dedalus.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Yes, yes, said Mr Dedalus.I meant about the ...I was thinking about the bad language of the railway porter. <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b> now, that's all right. Here, Stephen, show me your plate, old chap. Eat away now. Here.</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b>, you can't say but you were asked.I thinkI had better eat it myself becauseI'm not <b><font color='red'>well</font></b> in my health lately.</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b> now, the day kept up fine after all. There were plenty of strangers down too.</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b>, my Christmas dinner has been spoiled anyhow.</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b>, it is perfectly dreadful to say that not even for one day in the year, said Mrs Dedalus, can we be free from these dreadful disputes!</p><hr>
<p> He took up his knife and fork again in <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> humour and set to eating, saying to Mr Casey:</p><hr>
<p> Stephen looked with affection at Mr Casey's face which stared across the table over his joined hands. He liked to sit near him at the fire, looking up at his dark fierce face. But his dark eyes were never fierce and his slow voice was <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> to listen to. But why was he then against the priests? Because Dante must be right then. But he had heard his father say that she was a spoiled nun and that she had come out of the convent in the Alleghanies when her brother had got the money from the savages for the trinkets and the chainies. Perhaps that made her severe against Parnell. And she did not like him to play with Eileen because Eileen was a protestant and when she was young she knew children that used to play with protestants and the protestants used to make fun of the litany of the Blessed Virgin. TOWER OF IVORY, they used to say, HOUSE OF GOLD! How could a woman be a tower of ivory or a house of gold? Who was right then? And he remembered the evening in the infirmary in Clongowes, the dark waters, the light at the pierhead and the moan of sorrow from the people when they had heard.</p><hr>
<p>â €” It was down in Arklow one day. We were down there at a meeting and after the meeting was over we had to make our way to the railway station through the crowd. Such booing and baaing, man, you never heard. They called us all the names in the world. <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b> there was one old lady, and a drunken old harridan she was surely, that paid all her attention to me. She kept dancing along beside me in the mud bawling and screaming into my face: PRIEST-HUNTER! THE PARIS FUNDS! MR FOX! KITTYO'SHEA!</p><hr>
<p>â €”I let her bawl away, said Mr Casey. It was a cold day and to keep up my heartI had( saving your presence, ma'am) a quid of Tullamore in my mouth and sureI couldn't say a word in any case because my mouth was <b><font color='red'>full</font></b> of tobacco juice.</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b>, John?</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b>.I let her bawl away, to her heart's content, KITTYO'SHEA and the rest of it till at last she called that lady a name thatI won't sully this Christmas board nor your ears, ma'am, nor my own lips by repeating.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Do! said Mr Casey. She stuck her ugly old face up at me when she said it andI had my mouth <b><font color='red'>full</font></b> of tobacco juice.I bent down to her and PHTH! saysI to her like that.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Do you see that old chap up there, John? he said. He was a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> Irishman when there was no money in the job. He was condemned to death as a whiteboy. But he had a saying about our clerical friends, that he would never let one of them put his two feet under his mahogany.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Very <b><font color='red'>well</font></b> then, he shouted hoarsely, if it comes to that, no God for Ireland!</p><hr>
<p> Stephen, raising his terror-stricken face, saw that his father's eyes were <b><font color='red'>full</font></b> of tears.</p><hr>
<p>â €”A fat lot you know about it, Thunder! <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b> said.I know why they scut.</p><hr>
<p>â €”I was told not to, <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b> said.</p><hr>
<p>â €”O, go on, <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b>, all said. You might tell us. We won't let it out.</p><hr>
<p> Stephen bent forward his head to hear. <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b> looked round to see if anyone was coming. Then he said secretly:</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b>, they drank that and it was found out who did it by the smell. And that's why they ran away, if you want to know.</p><hr>
<p> Stephen looked at the faces of the fellows but they were all looking across the playground. He wanted to ask somebody about it. What did that mean about the smugging in the square? Why did the five fellows out of the higher line run away for that? It was a joke, he thought. Simon Moonan had nice clothes and one night he had shown him a ball of creamy sweets that the fellows of the football fifteen had rolled down to him along the carpet in the middle of the refectory when he was at the door. It was the night of the match against the Bective Rangers; and the ball was made just like a red and green apple only it opened and it was <b><font color='red'>full</font></b> of the creamy sweets. And one day Boyle had said that an elephant had two tuskers instead of two tusks and that was why he was called Tusker Boyle but some fellows called him Lady Boyle because he was always at his nails, paring them.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Yes, said <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b>. And old Barrett has a new way of twisting the note so that you can't open it and fold it again to see how many ferulae you are to get.I won't come back too.</p><hr>
<p> <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b> asked:</p><hr>
<p>â €” No, no, said Athy. They'll both get it on the vital spot. <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b> rubbed himself and said in a crying voice:</p><hr>
<p> During the writing lesson he sat with his arms folded, listening to the slow scraping of the pens. Mr Harford went to and fro making little signs in red pencil and sometimes sitting beside the boy to show him how to hold his pen. He had tried to spell out the headline for himself though he knew already what it was for it was the last of the book. ZEAL WITHOUT PRUDENCE IS LIKEA SHIP ADRIFT. But the lines of the letters were like fine invisible threads and it was only by closing his right eye tight and staring out of the left eye that he could make out the <b><font color='red'>full</font></b> curves of the capital.</p><hr>
<p> But Mr Harford was very decent and never got into a wax. All the other masters got into dreadful waxes. But why were they to suffer for what fellows in the higher line did? <b><font color='red'>Wells</font></b> had said that they had drunk some of the altar wine out of the press in the sacristy and that it had been found out who had done it by the smell. Perhaps they had stolen a monstrance to run away with and sell it somewhere. That must have been a terrible sin, to go in there quietly at night, to open the dark press and steal the flashing gold thing into which God was put on the altar in the middle of flowers and candles at benediction while the incense went up in clouds at both sides as the fellow swung the censer and Dominic Kelly sang the first part by himself in the choir. But God was not in it of course when they stole it. But still it was a strange and a great sin even to touch it. He thought of it with deep awe; a terrible and strange sin: it thrilled him to think of it in the silence when the pens scraped lightly. But to drink the altar wine out of the press and be found out by the smell was a sin too: but it was not terrible and strange. It only made you feel a little sickish on account of the smell of the wine. Because on the day when he had made his first holy communion in the chapel he had shut his eyes and opened his mouth and put out his tongue a little: and when the rector had stooped down to give him the holy communion he had smelt a faint winy smell off the rector's breath after the wine of the mass. The word was beautiful: wine. It made you think of dark purple because the grapes were dark purple that grew in Greece outside houses like white temples. But the faint smell of the rector's breath had made him feel a sick feeling on the morning of his first communion. The day of your first communion was the happiest day of your life. And once a lot of generals had asked Napoleon what was the happiest day of his life. They thought he would say the day he won some great battle or the day he was made an emperor. But he said:</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b>, my little man, said the rector, what is it?</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b>, if we broke our glasses we must write home for a new pair.</p><hr>
<p>â €”O, <b><font color='red'>well</font></b>, it was a mistake;I am sure Father Dolan did not know.</p><hr>
<p>â €”O <b><font color='red'>well</font></b> then, said the rector, Father Dolan did not understand. You can say thatI excuse you from your lessons for a few days.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Very <b><font color='red'>well</font></b>, the rector said, it is a mistake andI shall speak to Father Dolan myself. Will that do now?</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Good</font></b> day now, said the rector, withdrawing his hand and bowing.</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Good</font></b> day, sir, said Stephen.</p><hr>
