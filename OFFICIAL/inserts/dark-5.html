<p> He drained his third cup of watery tea to the dregs and set to chewing the crusts of fried bread that were scattered near him, staring into the <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> pool of the jar. The yellow dripping had been scooped out like a boghole and the pool under it brought back to his memory the <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> turf-coloured water of the bath in Clongowes. The box of pawn tickets at his elbow had just been rifled and he took up idly one after another in his greasy fingers the <b><font color='red'>blue</font></b> and white dockets, scrawled and sanded and creased and bearing the name of the pledger as Daly or MacEvoy.</p><hr>
<p>â €”I can't,I'm going for <b><font color='red'>blue</font></b>. Fill it out, you, Maggy.</p><hr>
<p> The rain-laden trees of the avenue evoked in him, as always, memories of the girls and women in the plays of Gerhart Hauptmann; and the memory of their pale sorrows and the fragrance falling from the wet branches mingled in a mood of quiet joy. His morning walk across the city had begun, and he foreknew that as he passed the sloblands of Fairview he would think of the cloistral silver-veined prose of Newman; that as he walked along the North Strand Road, glancing idly at the windows of the provision shops, he would recall the <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> humour of Guido Cavalcanti and smile; that as he went by Baird's stonecutting works in Talbot Place the spirit of Ibsen would blow through him like a keen wind, a spirit of wayward boyish beauty; and that passing a grimy marine dealer's shop beyond the Liffey he would repeat the song by Ben Jonson which begins:</p><hr>
<p> Eleven! Then he was late for that lecture too. What day of the week was it? He stopped at a newsagent's to read the headline of a placard. Thursday. Ten to eleven, English; eleven to twelve, French; twelve to one, physics. He fancied to himself the English lecture and felt, even at that distance, restless and helpless. He saw the heads of his classmates meekly bent as they wrote in their notebooks the points they were bidden to note, nominal definitions, essential definitions and examples or dates of birth or death, chief works, a favourable and an unfavourable criticism side by side. His own head was unbent for his thoughts wandered abroad and whether he looked around the little class of students or out of the window across the desolate gardens of the green an odour assailed him of cheerless cellar-damp and decay. Another head than his, right before him in the first benches, was poised squarely above its bending fellows like the head of a priest appealing without humility to the tabernacle for the humble worshippers about him. Why was it that when he thought of Cranly he could never raise before his mind the entire image of his body but only the image of the head and face? Even now against the grey curtain of the morning he saw it before him like the phantom of a dream, the face of a severed head or death-mask, crowned on the brows by its stiff <b><font color='red'>black</font></b> upright hair as by an iron crown. It was a priest-like face, priest-like in its palor, in the wide winged nose, in the shadowings below the eyes and along the jaws, priest-like in the lips that were long and bloodless and faintly smiling; and Stephen, remembering swiftly how he had told Cranly of all the tumults and unrest and longings in his soul, day after day and <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> by <b><font color='red'>night</font></b>, only to be answered by his friend's listening silence, would have told himself that it was the face of a guilty priest who heard confessions of those whom he had not power to absolve but that he felt again in memory the gaze of its <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> womanish eyes.</p><hr>
<p> Through this image he had a glimpse of a strange <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> cavern of speculation but at once turned away from it, feeling that it was not yet the hour to enter it. But the nightshade of his friend's listlessness seemed to be diffusing in the air around him a tenuous and deadly exhalation and he found himself glancing from one casual word to another on his right or left in stolid wonder that they had been so silently emptied of instantaneous sense until every mean shop legend bound his mind like the words of a spell and his soul shrivelled up sighing with age as he walked on in a lane among heaps of dead language. His own consciousness of language was ebbing from his brain and trickling into the very words themselves which set to band and disband themselves in wayward rhythms:</p><hr>
<p> The homely version of his christian name on the lips of his friend had touched Stephen pleasantly when first heard for he was as formal in speech with others as they were with him. Often, as he sat in Davin's rooms in Grantham Street, wondering at his friend's well-made boots that flanked the wall pair by pair and repeating for his friend's simple ear the verses and cadences of others which were the veils of his own longing and dejection, the rude Firbolg mind of his listener had drawn his mind towards it and flung it back again, drawing it by a quiet inbred courtesy of attention or by a quaint turn of old English speech or by the force of its delight in rude bodily skillâ €” for Davin had sat at the feet of Michael Cusack, the Gaelâ €” repelling swiftly and suddenly by a grossness of intelligence or by a bluntness of feeling or by a dull stare of terror in the eyes, the terror of soul of a starving Irish village in which the curfew was still a <b><font color='red'>nightly</font></b> fear.</p><hr>
<p> One <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> the young peasant, his spirit stung by the violent or luxurious language in which Stephen escaped from the cold silence of intellectual revolt, had called up before Stephen's mind a strange vision. The two were walking slowly towards Davin's rooms through the <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> narrow streets of the poorer jews.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Well,I suppose that doesn't interest you, but leastways there was such noise after the match thatI missed the train home andI couldn't get any kind of a yoke to give me a lift for, as luck would have it, there was a mass meeting that same day over in Castletownroche and all the cars in the country were there. So there was nothing for it only to stay the <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> or to foot it out. Well,I started to walk and onI went and it was coming on <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> whenI got into the Ballyhoura hills, that's better than ten miles from Kilmallock and there's a long lonely road after that. You wouldn't see the sign of a christian house along the road or hear a sound. It was pitch <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> almost. Once or twiceI stopped by the way under a bush to redden my pipe and only for the dew was thickI'd have stretched out there and slept. At last, after a bend of the road,I spied a little cottage with a light in the window.I went up and knocked at the door.A voice asked who was there andI answeredI was over at the match in Buttevant and was walking back and thatI'd be thankful for a glass of water. After a while a young woman opened the door and brought me out a big mug of milk. She was half undressed as if she was going to bed whenI knocked and she had her hair hanging andI thought by her figure and by something in the look of her eyes that she must be carrying a child. She kept me in talk a long while at the door, andI thought it strange because her breast and her shoulders were bare. She asked me wasI tired and wouldI like to stop the <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> there. She said she was all alone in the house and that her husband had gone that morning to Queenstown with his sister to see her off. And all the time she was talking, Stevie, she had her eyes fixed on my face and she stood so close to meI could hear her breathing. WhenI handed her back the mug at last she took my hand to draw me in over the threshold and said:'COME IN AND STAY THE <b><font color='red'>NIGHT</font></b> HERE. YOU'VE NO CALL TO BE FRIGHTENED. THERE'S NO ONE IN IT BUT OURSELVES ...'I didn't go in, Stevie.I thanked her and went on my way again, all in a fever. At the first bend of the roadI looked back and she was standing at the door.</p><hr>
<p> The last words of Davin's story sang in his memory and the figure of the woman in the story stood forth reflected in other figures of the peasant women whom he had seen standing in the doorways at Clane as the college cars drove by, as a type of her race and of his own, a bat-like soul waking to the consciousness of itself in <b><font color='red'>darkness</font></b> and secrecy and loneliness and, through the eyes and voice and gesture of a woman without guile, calling the stranger to her bed.</p><hr>
<p> The <b><font color='red'>blue</font></b> flowers which she lifted towards him and her young <b><font color='red'>blue</font></b> eyes seemed to him at that instant images of guilelessness, and he halted till the image had vanished and he saw only her ragged dress and damp coarse hair and hoydenish face.</p><hr>
<p> It was too late to go upstairs to the French class. He crossed the hall and took the corridor to the left which led to the physics theatre. The corridor was <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> and silent but not unwatchful. Why did he feel that it was not unwatchful? Was it because he had heard that in Buck Whaley's time there was a secret staircase there? Or was the jesuit house extra-territorial and was he walking among aliens? The Ireland of Tone and of Parnell seemed to have receded in space.</p><hr>
<p> The entrance hall was crowded and loud with talk. On a table near the door were two photographs in frames and between them a long roll of paper bearing an irregular tail of signatures. MacCann went briskly to and fro among the students, talking rapidly, answering rebuffs and leading one after another to the table. In the <b><font color='red'>inner</font></b> hall the dean of studies stood talking to a young professor, stroking his chin gravely and nodding his head.</p><hr>
<p> Stephen, checked by the crowd at the door, halted irresolutely. From under the wide falling leaf of a soft hat Cranly's <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> eyes were watching him.</p><hr>
<p> His smiling eyes were fixed on a silver-wrapped tablet of milk chocolate which peeped out of the propagandist's breast-pocket.A little ring of listeners closed round to hear the war of wits.A lean student with olive skin and lank <b><font color='red'>black</font></b> hair thrust his face between the two, glancing from one to the other at each phrase and seeming to try to catch each flying phrase in his open moist mouth. Cranly took a small grey handball from his pocket and began to examine it closely, turning it over and over.</p><hr>
<p>â €”I'm a believer in universal brotherhood, said Temple, glancing about him out of his <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> oval eyes. Marx is only a bloody cod.</p><hr>
<p> As they crossed the <b><font color='red'>inner</font></b> hall, the dean of studies was in the act of escaping from the student with whom he had been conversing. He stood at the foot of the staircase, a foot on the lowest step, his threadbare soutane gathered about him for the ascent with womanish care, nodding his head often and repeating:</p><hr>
<p>â €”I'm a simple person, said Davin. You know that. When you told me that <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> in Harcourt Street those things about your private life, honest to God, Stevie,I was not able to eat my dinner.I was quite bad.I was awake a long time that <b><font color='red'>night</font></b>. Why did you tell me those things?</p><hr>
<p>â €” The soul is born, he said vaguely, first in those momentsI told you of. It has a slow and <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> birth, more mysterious than the birth of the body. When the soul of a man is born in this country there are nets flung at it to hold it back from flight. You talk to me of nationality, language, religion.I shall try to fly by those nets.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Stop!I won't listen!I am sick.I was out last <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> on a yellow drunk with Horan and Goggins.</p><hr>
<p>â €” That was the first definitionI gave you, you sleepy-headed wretch, said Stephen, whenI began to try to think out the matter for myself. Do you remember the <b><font color='red'>night</font></b>? Cranly lost his temper and began to talk about Wicklow bacon.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Did you hear the results of the exams? he asked. Griffin was plucked. Halpin andO'Flynn are through the home civil. Moonan got fifth place in the Indian.O'Shaughnessy got fourteenth. The Irish fellows in Clark's gave them a feed last <b><font color='red'>night</font></b>. They all ate curry.</p><hr>
<p>â €” That you told me a few <b><font color='red'>nights</font></b> ago, said Lynch, and we began the famous discussion.</p><hr>
<p> The quick light shower had drawn off, tarrying in clusters of diamonds among the shrubs of the quadrangle where an exhalation was breathed forth by the <b><font color='red'>blackened</font></b> earth. Their trim boots prattled as they stood on the steps of the colonnade, talking quietly and gaily, glancing at the clouds, holding their umbrellas at cunning angles against the few last raindrops, closing them again, holding their skirts demurely.</p><hr>
<p> An enchantment of the heart! The <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> had been enchanted. In a dream or vision he had known the ecstasy of seraphic life. Was it an instant of enchantment only or long hours and years and ages?</p><hr>
<p> At certain instants her eyes seemed about to trust him but he had waited in vain. She passed now dancing lightly across his memory as she had been that <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> at the carnival ball, her white dress a little lifted, a white spray nodding in her hair. She danced lightly in the round. She was dancing towards him and, as she came, her eyes were a little averted and a faint glow was on her cheek. At the pause in the chain of hands her hand had lain in his an instant, a soft merchandise.</p><hr>
<p> And yet he felt that, however he might revile and mock her image, his anger was also a form of homage. He had left the classroom in disdain that was not wholly sincere, feeling that perhaps the secret of her race lay behind those <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> eyes upon which her long lashes flung a quick shadow. He had told himself bitterly as he walked through the streets that she was a figure of the womanhood of her country, a bat-like soul waking to the consciousness of itself in <b><font color='red'>darkness</font></b> and secrecy and loneliness, tarrying awhile, loveless and sinless, with her mild lover and leaving him to whisper of innocent transgressions in the latticed ear of a priest. His anger against her found vent in coarse railing at her paramour, whose name and voice and features offended his baffled pride: a priested peasant, with a brother a policeman in Dublin and a brother a potboy in Moycullen. To him she would unveil her soul's shy nakedness, to one who was but schooled in the discharging of a formal rite rather than to him, a priest of the eternal imagination, transmuting the daily bread of experience into the radiant body of everliving life.</p><hr>
<p> He had written verses for her again after ten years. Ten years before she had worn her shawl cowlwise about her head, sending sprays of her warm breath into the <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> air, tapping her foot upon the glassy road. It was the last tram; the lank brown horses knew it and shook their bells to the clear <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> in admonition. The conductor talked with the driver, both nodding often in the green light of the lamp. They stood on the steps of the tram, he on the upper, she on the lower. She came up to his step many times between their phrases and went down again and once or twice remained beside him forgetting to go down and then went down. Let be! Let be!</p><hr>
<p> He began to feel that he had wronged her.A sense of her innocence moved him almost to pity her, an innocence he had never understood till he had come to the knowledge of it through sin, an innocence which she too had not understood while she was innocent or before the strange humiliation of her nature had first come upon her. Then first her soul had begun to live as his soul had when he had first sinned, and a tender compassion filled his heart as he remembered her frail pallor and her eyes, humbled and saddened by the <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> shame of womanhood.</p><hr>
<p>A glow of desire kindled again his soul and fired and fulfilled all his body. Conscious of his desire she was waking from odorous sleep, the temptress of his villanelle. Her eyes, <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> and with a look of languor, were opening to his eyes. Her nakedness yielded to him, radiant, warm, odorous and lavish-limbed, enfolded him like a shining cloud, enfolded him like water with a liquid life; and like a cloud of vapour or like waters circumfluent in space the liquid letters of speech, symbols of the element of mystery, flowed forth over his brain.</p><hr>
<p> What birds were they? He stood on the steps of the library to look at them, leaning wearily on his ashplant. They flew round and round the jutting shoulder of a house in Molesworth Street. The air of the late March evening made clear their flight, their <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> quivering bodies flying clearly against the sky as against a limp-hung cloth of smoky tenuous <b><font color='red'>blue</font></b>.</p><hr>
<p> He watched their flight; bird after bird: a <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> flash, a swerve, a flutter of wings. He tried to count them before all their darting quivering bodies passed: six, ten, eleven: and wondered were they odd or even in number. Twelve, thirteen: for two came wheeling down from the upper sky. They were flying high and low but ever round and round in straight and curving lines and ever flying from left to right, circling about a temple of air.</p><hr>
<p> The inhuman clamour soothed his ears in which his mother's sobs and reproaches murmured insistently and the <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> frail quivering bodies wheeling and fluttering and swerving round an airy temple of the tenuous sky soothed his eyes which still saw the image of his mother's face.</p><hr>
<p> They came back with shrill cries over the jutting shoulder of the house, flying <b><font color='red'>darkly</font></b> against the fading air. What birds were they? He thought that they must be swallows who had come back from the south. Then he was to go away for they were birds ever going and coming, building ever an unlasting home under the eaves of men's houses and ever leaving the homes they had built to wander.</p><hr>
<p> Symbol of departure or of loneliness? The verses crooned in the ear of his memory composed slowly before his remembering eyes the scene of the hall on the <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> of the opening of the national theatre. He was alone at the side of the balcony, looking out of jaded eyes at the culture of Dublin in the stalls and at the tawdry scene-cloths and human dolls framed by the garish lamps of the stage.A burly policeman sweated behind him and seemed at every moment about to act. The catcalls and hisses and mocking cries ran in rude gusts round the hall from his scattered fellow students.</p><hr>
<p> Dixon smiled and turned his ring. The <b><font color='red'>blackish</font></b>, monkey-puckered face pursed its human mouth with gentle pleasure and its voice purred:</p><hr>
<p> Temple turned on him his <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> gipsy eyes.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Is he descended from Baldwin too? asked a tall consumptive student with <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> eyes.</p><hr>
<p> He was watching Cranly's firm-featured suffering face, lit up now by a smile of false patience. The gross name had passed over it like foul water poured over an old stone image, patient of injuries; and, as he watched him, he saw him raise his hat in salute and uncover the <b><font color='red'>black</font></b> hair that stood stiffly from his forehead like an iron crown.</p><hr>
<p> She had passed through the dusk. And therefore the air was silent save for one soft hiss that fell. And therefore the tongues about him had ceased their babble. <b><font color='red'>Darkness</font></b> was falling.</p><hr>
<p> <b><font color='red'>Darkness</font></b> falls from the air.A trembling joy, lambent as a faint light, played like a fairy host around him. But why? Her passage through the <b><font color='red'>darkening</font></b> air or the verse with its <b><font color='red'>black</font></b> vowels and its opening sound, rich and lutelike?</p><hr>
<p> Eyes, opening from the <b><font color='red'>darkness</font></b> of desire, eyes that dimmed the breaking east. What was their languid grace but the softness of chambering? And what was their shimmer but the shimmer of the scum that mantled the cesspool of the court of a slobbering Stuart. And he tasted in the language of memory ambered wines, dying fallings of sweet airs, the proud pavan, and saw with the eyes of memory kind gentlewomen in Covent Garden wooing from their balconies with sucking mouths and the pox-fouled wenches of the taverns and young wives that, gaily yielding to their ravishers, clipped and clipped again.</p><hr>
<p>A louse crawled over the nape of his neck and, putting his thumb and forefinger deftly beneath his loose collar, he caught it. He rolled its body, tender yet brittle as a grain of rice, between thumb and finger for an instant before he let it fall from him and wondered would it live or die. There came to his mind a curious phrase from CORNELIUSA LAPIDE which said that the lice born of human sweat were not created by God with the other animals on the sixth day. But the tickling of the skin of his neck made his mind raw and red. The life of his body, ill clad, ill fed, louse-eaten, made him close his eyelids in a sudden spasm of despair and in the <b><font color='red'>darkness</font></b> he saw the brittle bright bodies of lice falling from the air and turning often as they fell. Yes, and it was not <b><font color='red'>darkness</font></b> that fell from the air. It was brightness.</p><hr>
<p> He came back quickly along the colonnade towards the group of students. Well then, let her go and be damned to her! She could love some clean athlete who washed himself every morning to the waist and had <b><font color='red'>black</font></b> hair on his chest. Let her.</p><hr>
<p> How could he hit their conscience or how cast his shadow over the imaginations of their daughters, before their squires begat upon them, that they might breed a race less ignoble than their own? And under the deepened dusk he felt the thoughts and desires of the race to which he belonged flitting like bats across the <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> country lanes, under trees by the edges of streams and near the pool-mottled bogs.A woman had waited in the doorway as Davin had passed by at <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> and, offering him a cup of milk, had all but wooed him to her bed; for Davin had the mild eyes of one who could be secret. But him no woman's eyes had wooed.</p><hr>
<p>â €”I fear many things: dogs, horses, fire-arms, the sea, thunder-storms, machinery, the country roads at <b><font color='red'>night</font></b>.</p><hr>
<p> The soft beauty of the Latin word touched with an enchanting touch the <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> of the evening, with a touch fainter and more persuading than the touch of music or of a woman's hand. The strife of their minds was quelled. The figure of a woman as she appears in the liturgy of the church passed silently through the <b><font color='red'>darkness</font></b>: a white-robed figure, small and slender as a boy, and with a falling girdle. Her voice, frail and high as a boy's, was heard intoning from a distant choir the first words of a woman which pierce the gloom and clamour of the first chanting of the passion:</p><hr>
<p> His hat had come down on his forehead. He shoved it back and in the shadow of the trees Stephen saw his pale face, framed by the <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b>, and his large <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> eyes. Yes. His face was handsome and his body was strong and hard. He had spoken of a mother's love. He felt then the sufferings of women, the weaknesses of their bodies and souls: and would shield them with a strong and resolute arm and bow his mind to them.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Because, Cranly continued, you need not look upon yourself as driven away if you do not wish to go or as a heretic or an outlaw. There are many good believers who think as you do. Would that surprise you? The church is not the stone building nor even the clergy and their dogmas. It is the whole mass of those born into it.I don't know what you wish to do in life. Is it what you told me the <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> we were standing outside Harcourt Street station?</p><hr>
<p>â €” Yes, Stephen said, smiling in spite of himself at Cranly's way of remembering thoughts in connexion with places. The <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> you spent half an hour wrangling with Doherty about the shortest way from Sallygap to Larras.</p><hr>
<p> MARCH 21, MORNING. Thought this in bed last <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> but was too lazy and free to add to it. Free, yes. The exhausted loins are those of Elizabeth and Zacchary. Then he is the precursor. Item: he eats chiefly belly bacon and dried figs. Read locusts and wild honey. Also, when thinking of him, saw always a stern severed head or death mask as if outlined on a grey curtain or veronica. Decollation they call it in the gold. Puzzled for the moment by saint John at the Latin gate. What doI see?A decollated percursor trying to pick the lock.</p><hr>
<p> MARCH 21, <b><font color='red'>NIGHT</font></b>. Free. Soul free and fancy free. Let the dead bury the dead. Ay. And let the dead marry the dead.</p><hr>
<p> MARCH 23. Have not seen her since that <b><font color='red'>night</font></b>. Unwell? Sits at the fire perhaps with mamma's shawl on her shoulders. But not peevish.A nice bowl of gruel? Won't you now?</p><hr>
<p> Crossing Stephen's, that is, my green, remembered that his countrymen and not mine had invented what Cranly the other <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> called our religion.A quartet of them, soldiers of the ninety-seventh infantry regiment, sat at the foot of the cross and tossed up dice for the overcoat of the crucified.</p><hr>
<p> MARCH 25, MORNING.A troubled <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> of dreams. Want to get them off my chest.</p><hr>
<p>A long curving gallery. From the floor ascend pillars of <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> vapours. It is peopled by the images of fabulous kings, set in stone. Their hands are folded upon their knees in token of weariness and their eyes are <b><font color='red'>darkened</font></b> for the errors of men go up before them for ever as <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> vapours.</p><hr>
<p> Strange figures advance as from a cave. They are not as tall as men. One does not seem to stand quite apart from another. Their faces are phosphorescent, with <b><font color='red'>darker</font></b> streaks. They peer at me and their eyes seem to ask me something. They do not speak.</p><hr>
<p> APRIL3. Met Davin at the cigar shop opposite Findlater's church. He was in a <b><font color='red'>black</font></b> sweater and had a hurley stick. Asked me was it trueI was going away and why. Told him the shortest way to Tara was VIA Holyhead. Just then my father came up. Introduction. Father polite and observant. Asked Davin if he might offer him some refreshment. Davin could not, was going to a meeting. When we came away father told me he had a good honest eye. Asked me whyI did not join a rowing club.I pretended to think it over. Told me then how he broke Pennyfeather's heart. Wants me to read law. SaysI was cut out for that. More mud, more crocodiles.</p><hr>
<p> APRIL5. Wild spring. Scudding clouds.O life! <b><font color='red'>Dark</font></b> stream of swirling bogwater on which apple-trees have cast down their delicate flowers. Eyes of girls among the leaves. Girls demure and romping. All fair or auburn: no <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> ones. They blush better. Houpla!</p><hr>
<p> APRIL 10. Faintly, under the heavy <b><font color='red'>night</font></b>, through the silence of the city which has turned from dreams to dreamless sleep as a weary lover whom no caresses move, the sound of hoofs upon the road. Not so faintly now as they come near the bridge; and in a moment, as they pass the <b><font color='red'>darkened</font></b> windows, the silence is cloven by alarm as by an arrow. They are heard now far away, hoofs that shine amid the heavy <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> as gems, hurrying beyond the sleeping fields to what journey's endâ €” what heart?â €” bearing what tidings?</p><hr>
<p> APRIL 11. Read whatI wrote last <b><font color='red'>night</font></b>. Vague words for a vague emotion. Would she like it?I think so. ThenI should have to like it also.</p><hr>
<p>I fear him.I fear his red-rimmed horny eyes. It is with himI must struggle all through this <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> till day come, till he orI lie dead, gripping him by the sinewy throat till ... Till what? Till he yield to me? No.I mean no harm.</p><hr>
<p> The spell of arms and voices: the white arms of roads, their promise of close embraces and the <b><font color='red'>black</font></b> arms of tall ships that stand against the moon, their tale of distant nations. They are held out to say: We are aloneâ €” come. And the voices say with them: We are your kinsmen. And the air is thick with their company as they call to me, their kinsman, making ready to go, shaking the wings of their exultant and terrible youth.</p><hr>
