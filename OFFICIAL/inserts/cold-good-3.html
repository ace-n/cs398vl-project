<p>A wasting breath of humiliation blew bleakly over his soul to think of how he had fallen, to feel that those souls were <b><font color='red'>dearer</font></b> to God than his. The wind blew over him and passed on to the myriads and myriads of other souls on whom God's favour shone now more and now less, stars now brighter and now dimmer sustained and failing. And the glimmering souls passed away, sustained and failing, merged in a moving breath. One soul was lost; a tiny soul: his. It flickered once and went out, forgotten, lost. The end: black, <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b>, void waste.</p><hr>
