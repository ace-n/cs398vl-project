<p> The voice of his youngest brother from the farther side of the fireplace began to sing the air OFT IN THE STILLY <b><font color='blue'>NIGHT</font></b>. One by one the others took up the air until a <b><font color='red'>full</font></b> choir of voices was singing. They would sing so for hours, melody after melody, glee after glee, till the last pale light died down on the horizon, till the first <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b> clouds came forth and <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b> fell.</p><hr>
<p>A girl stood before him in midstream, alone and still, gazing out to sea. She seemed like one whom magic had changed into the likeness of a strange and beautiful seabird. Her long slender bare legs were delicate as a crane's and pure save where an emerald trail of seaweed had fashioned itself as a sign upon the flesh. Her thighs, <b><font color='red'>fuller</font></b> and soft-hued as ivory, were bared almost to the hips, where the white fringes of her drawers were like feathering of soft white down. Her slate-blue skirts were kilted boldly about her waist and dovetailed behind her. Her bosom was as a bird's, soft and slight, slight and soft as the breast of some <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b>-plumaged dove. But her long fair hair was girlish: and girlish, and touched with the wonder of mortal beauty, her face.</p><hr>
