<p> The imagery through which the nature and kinship of the Three Persons of the Trinity were <b><font color='blue'>darkly</font></b> shadowed forth in the books of devotion which he readâ €” the Father contemplating from all eternity as in a mirror His Divine Perfections and thereby begetting eternally the Eternal Son and the Holy Spirit proceeding out of Father and Son from all eternityâ €” were <b><font color='red'>easier</font></b> of acceptance by his mind by reason of their august incomprehensibility than was the simple fact that God had loved his soul from all eternity, for ages before he had been born into the world, for ages before the world itself had existed.</p><hr>
<p> He crossed the bridge over the stream of the Tolka and turned his eyes coldly for an instant towards the faded <b><font color='blue'>blue</font></b> shrine of the Blessed Virgin which stood fowl-wise on a pole in the middle of a ham-shaped encampment of poor cottages. Then, bending to the left, he followed the lane which led up to his house. The <b><font color='red'>faint</font></b> sour stink of rotted cabbages came towards him from the kitchen gardens on the rising ground above the river. He smiled to think that it was this disorder, the misrule and confusion of his father's house and the stagnation of vegetable life, which was to win the day in his soul. Then a short laugh broke from his lips as he thought of that solitary farmhand in the kitchen gardens behind their house whom they had nicknamed the man with the hat.A second laugh, taking rise from the first after a pause, broke from him involuntarily as he thought of how the man with the hat worked, considering in turn the four points of the sky and then regretfully plunging his spade in the earth.</p><hr>
<p> The voice of his youngest brother from the farther side of the fireplace began to sing the air OFT IN THE STILLY <b><font color='blue'>NIGHT</font></b>. One by one the others took up the air until a full choir of voices was singing. They would sing so for hours, melody after melody, glee after glee, till the last pale <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> died down on the horizon, till the first <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b> clouds came forth and <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b> fell.</p><hr>
<p> The phrase and the day and the scene harmonized in a chord. Words. Was it their colours? He allowed them to glow and fade, hue after hue: sunrise gold, the russet and green of apple orchards, azure of waves, the grey-fringed fleece of clouds. No, it was not their colours: it was the poise and balance of the period itself. Did he then love the rhythmic rise and <b><font color='red'>fall</font></b> of words better than their associations of legend and colour? Or was it that, being as weak of sight as he was shy of mind, he drew less pleasure from the reflection of the glowing sensible world through the prism of a language many-coloured and richly storied than from the contemplation of an <b><font color='blue'>inner</font></b> world of individual emotions mirrored perfectly in a lucid supple periodic prose?</p><hr>
<p> He passed from the trembling bridge on to firm land again. At that instant, as it seemed to him, the air was chilled and, looking askance towards the water, he saw a flying squall <b><font color='blue'>darkening</font></b> and crisping suddenly the tide.A <b><font color='red'>faint</font></b> click at his heart, a <b><font color='red'>faint</font></b> throb in his throat told him once more of how his flesh dreaded the cold infrahuman odour of the sea; yet he did not strike across the downs on his left but held straight on along the spine of rocks that pointed against the river's mouth.</p><hr>
<p> He started up nervously from the stone-block for he could no longer quench the flame in his blood. He felt his cheeks aflame and his throat throbbing with song. There was a lust of wandering in his feet that burned to set out for the ends of the earth. On! On! his heart seemed to cry. Evening would deepen above the sea, <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b> <b><font color='red'>fall</font></b> upon the plains, dawn glimmer before the wanderer and show him strange fields and hills and faces. Where?</p><hr>
