<p> He crept about from point to point on the fringe of his line, making little runs now and then. But his hands were <b><font color='red'>bluish</font></b> with <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b>. He kept his hands in the side pockets of his belted grey suit. That was a belt round his pocket. And belt was also to give a fellow a belt. One day a fellow said to Cantwell:</p><hr>
<p> The <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> slime of the ditch covered his whole body; and, when the bell rang for study and the lines filed out of the playrooms, he felt the <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> air of the corridor and staircase inside his clothes. He still tried to think what was the right answer. Was it right to kiss his mother or wrong to kiss his mother? What did that mean, to kiss? You put your face up like that to say good <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> and then his mother put her face down. That was to kiss. His mother put her lips on his cheek; her lips were soft and they wetted his cheek; and they made a tiny little noise: kiss. Why did people do that with their two faces?</p><hr>
<p> It pained him that he did not know well what politics meant and that he did not know where the universe ended. He felt small and weak. When would he be like the fellows in poetry and rhetoric? They had big voices and big boots and they studied trigonometry. That was very far away. First came the vacation and then the next term and then vacation again and then again another term and then again the vacation. It was like a train going in and out of tunnels and that was like the noise of the boys eating in the refectory when you opened and closed the flaps of the ears. Term, vacation; tunnel, out; noise, stop. How far away it was! It was better to go to bed to sleep. Only prayers in the chapel and then bed. He shivered and yawned. It would be lovely in bed after the sheets got a bit hot. First they were so <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> to get into. He shivered to think how <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> they were first. But then they got hot and then he could sleep. It was lovely to be tired. He yawned again. <b><font color='red'>Night</font></b> prayers and then bed: he shivered and wanted to yawn. It would be lovely in a few minutes. He felt a warm glow creeping up from the <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> shivering sheets, warmer and warmer till he felt warm all over, ever so warm and yet he shivered a little and still wanted to yawn.</p><hr>
<p> The bell rang for <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> prayers and he filed out of the study hall after the others and down the staircase and along the corridors to the chapel. The corridors were <b><font color='red'>darkly</font></b> lit and the chapel was <b><font color='red'>darkly</font></b> lit. Soon all would be <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> and sleeping. There was <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> air in the chapel and the marbles were the colour the sea was at <b><font color='red'>night</font></b>. The sea was <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> day and <b><font color='red'>night</font></b>: but it was <b><font color='blue'>colder</font></b> at <b><font color='red'>night</font></b>. It was <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> and <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> under the seawall beside his father's house. But the kettle would be on the hob to make punch.</p><hr>
<p> There was a <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> smell in the chapel. But it was a holy smell. It was not like the smell of the old peasants who knelt at the back of the chapel at Sunday mass. That was a smell of air and rain and turf and corduroy. But they were very holy peasants. They breathed behind him on his neck and sighed as they prayed. They lived in Clane, a fellow said: there were little cottages there and he had seen a woman standing at the half-door of a cottage with a child in her arms as the cars had come past from Sallins. It would be lovely to sleep for one <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> in that cottage before the fire of smoking turf, in the <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> lit by the fire, in the warm <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b>, breathing the smell of the peasants, air and rain and turf and corduroy. ButO, the road there between the trees was <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b>! You would be lost in the <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b>. It made him afraid to think of how it was.</p><hr>
<p> He blessed himself and climbed quickly into bed and, tucking the end of the nightshirt under his feet, curled himself together under the <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> white sheets, shaking and trembling. But he would not go to hell when he died; and the shaking would stop.A voice bade the boys in the dormitory good <b><font color='red'>night</font></b>. He peered out for an instant over the coverlet and saw the yellow curtains round and before his bed that shut him off on all sides. The light was lowered quietly.</p><hr>
<p>O how <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> and strange it was to think of that! All the <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> was <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> and strange. There were pale strange faces there, great eyes like carriage-lamps. They were the ghosts of murderers, the figures of marshals who had received their death-wound on battlefields far away over the sea. What did they wish to say that their faces were so strange?</p><hr>
<p> It was not Wells's face, it was the prefect's. He was not foxing. No, no: he was sick really. He was not foxing. And he felt the prefect's hand on his forehead; and he felt his forehead warm and damp against the prefect's <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> damp hand. That was the way a rat felt, slimy and damp and <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b>. Every rat had two eyes to look out of. Sleek slimy coats, little little feet tucked up to jump, <b><font color='red'>black</font></b> slimy eyes to look out of. They could understand how to jump. But the minds of rats could not understand trigonometry. When they were dead they lay on their sides. Their coats dried then. They were only dead things.</p><hr>
<p> How far away they were! There was <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> sunlight outside the window. He wondered if he would die. You could die just the same on a sunny day. He might die before his mother came. Then he would have a dead mass in the chapel like the way the fellows had told him it was when Little had died. All the fellows would be at the mass, dressed in <b><font color='red'>black</font></b>, all with sad faces. Wells too would be there but no fellow would look at him. The rector would be there in a cope of <b><font color='red'>black</font></b> and gold and there would be tall yellow candles on the altar and round the catafalque. And they would carry the coffin out of the chapel slowly and he would be buried in the little graveyard of the community off the main avenue of limes. And Wells would be sorry then for what he had done. And the bell would toll slowly.</p><hr>
<p>â €” We are all sinners and <b><font color='red'>black</font></b> sinners, said Mr Casey <b><font color='blue'>coldly</font></b>.</p><hr>
