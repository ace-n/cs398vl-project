<p> When the order list had been booked the two would go on to the park where an old friend of Stephen's father, Mike Flynn, would be found seated on a bench, waiting for them. Then would begin Stephen's run round the park. Mike Flynn would stand at the gate near the railway station, watch in hand, while Stephen ran round the track in the style Mike Flynn favoured, his head high lifted, his knees <b><font color='red'>well</font></b> lifted and his hands held straight down by his sides. When the morning practice was over the trainer would make his comments and sometimes illustrate them by shuffling along for a yard or so comically in an old pair of <b><font color='blue'>blue</font></b> canvas shoes.A small ring of wonderstruck children and nursemaids would gather to watch him and linger even when he and uncle Charles had sat down again and were talking athletics and politics. Though he had heard his father say that Mike Flynn had put some of the best runners of modern times through his hands Stephen often glanced at his trainer's flabby stubble-covered face, as it bent over the long stained fingers through which he rolled his cigarette, and with pity at the mild lustreless <b><font color='blue'>blue</font></b> eyes which would look up suddenly from the task and gaze vaguely into the <b><font color='blue'>blue</font></b> distance while the long swollen fingers ceased their rolling and grains and fibres of tobacco fell back into the pouch.</p><hr>
<p> The coming of September did not trouble him this year for he was not to be sent back to Clongowes. The practice in the park came to an end when Mike Flynn went into hospital. Aubrey was at school and had only an hour or two free in the evening. The gang fell asunder and there were no more <b><font color='blue'>nightly</font></b> forays or battles on the rocks. Stephen sometimes went round with the car which delivered the evening milk and these chilly drives blew away his memory of the filth of the cowyard and he felt no repugnance at seeing the cow hairs and hayseeds on the milkman's coat. Whenever the car drew up before a house he waited to catch a glimpse of a <b><font color='red'>well</font></b> scrubbed kitchen or of a softly lighted hall and to see how the servant would hold the jug and how she would close the door. He thought it should be a pleasant life enough, driving along the roads every evening to deliver milk, if he had warm gloves and a fat bag of gingernuts in his pocket to eat from. But the same foreknowledge which had sickened his heart and made his legs sag suddenly as he raced round the park, the same intuition which had made him glance with mistrust at his trainer's flabby stubble-covered face as it bent heavily over his long stained fingers, dissipated any vision of the future. In a vague way he understood that his father was in trouble and that this was the reason why he himself had not been sent back to Clongowes. For some time he had felt the slight change in his house; and those changes in what he had deemed unchangeable were so many slight shocks to his boyish conception of the world. The ambition which he felt astir at times in the <b><font color='blue'>darkness</font></b> of his soul sought no outlet.A dusk like that of the outer world obscured his mind as he heard the mare's hoofs clattering along the tramtrack on the Rock Road and the great can swaying and rattling behind him.</p><hr>
<p> In the vestry a plump fresh-faced jesuit and an elderly man, in shabby <b><font color='blue'>blue</font></b> clothes, were dabbling in a case of paints and chalks. The boys who had been painted walked about or stood still awkwardly, touching their faces in a gingerly fashion with their furtive fingertips. In the middle of the vestry a young jesuit, who was then on a visit to the college, stood rocking himself rhythmically from the tips of his toes to his heels and back again, his hands thrust <b><font color='red'>well</font></b> forward into his side-pockets. His small head set off with glossy red curls and his newly shaven face agreed <b><font color='red'>well</font></b> with the spotless decency of his soutane and with his spotless shoes.</p><hr>
<p>â €” When you kick out for yourself, Stephenâ €” asI daresay you will one of these daysâ €” remember, whatever you do, to mix with gentlemen. WhenI was a young fellowI tell youI enjoyed myself.I mixed with fine decent fellows. Everyone of us could do something. One fellow had a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> voice, another fellow was a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> actor, another could sing a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> comic song, another was a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> oarsman or a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> racket player, another could tell a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> story and so on. We kept the ball rolling anyhow and enjoyed ourselves and saw a bit of life and we were none the worse of it either. But we were all gentlemen, Stephenâ €” at leastI hope we wereâ €” and bloody <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> honest Irishmen too. That's the kind of fellowsI want you to associate with, fellows of the right kidney.I'm talking to you as a friend, Stephen.I don't believe a son should be afraid of his father. No,I treat you as your grandfather treated me whenI was a young chap. We were more like brothers than father and son.I'll never forget the first day he caught me smoking.I was standing at the end of the South Terrace one day with some maneens like myself and sure we thought we were grand fellows because we had pipes stuck in the corners of our mouths. Suddenly the governor passed. He didn't say a word, or stop even. But the next day, Sunday, we were out for a walk together and when we were coming home he took out his cigar case and said:â €” By the by, Simon,I didn't know you smoked, or something like that.â €” Of courseI tried to carry it off as bestI could.â €” If you want a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> smoke, he said, try one of these cigars. An American captain made me a present of them last <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b> in Queenstown.</p><hr>
