<p> But the phrase on the priest's lips was disingenuous for he knew that a priest should not speak <b><font color='red'>lightly</font></b> on that theme. The phrase had been spoken <b><font color='red'>lightly</font></b> with design and he felt that his face was being searched by the eyes in the shadow. Whatever he had heard or read of the craft of jesuits he had put aside frankly as not borne out by his own experience. His masters, even when they had not attracted him, had seemed to him always intelligent and serious priests, athletic and high-spirited prefects. He thought of them as men who washed their bodies briskly with cold water and wore <b><font color='red'>clean</font></b> cold linen. During all the years he had lived among them in Clongowes and in Belvedere he had received only two pandies and, though these had been dealt him in the wrong, he knew that he had often escaped punishment. During all those years he had never heard from any of his masters a flippant word: it was they who had taught him christian doctrine and urged him to live a <b><font color='blue'>good</font></b> life and, when he had <b><font color='red'>fallen</font></b> into grievous sin, it was they who had led him back to grace. Their presence had made him diffident of himself when he was a muff in Clongowes and it had made him diffident of himself also while he had held his equivocal position in Belvedere.A constant sense of this had remained with him up to the last year of his school life. He had never once disobeyed or allowed turbulent companions to seduce him from his habit of quiet obedience; and, even when he doubted some statement of a master, he had never presumed to doubt openly. Lately some of their judgements had sounded a little childish in his ears and had made him feel a regret and pity as though he were slowly passing out of an accustomed world and were hearing its language for the last time. One day when some boys had gathered round a priest under the shed near the chapel, he had heard the priest say:</p><hr>
<p> The voice of his youngest brother from the farther side of the fireplace began to sing the air OFT IN THE STILLY NIGHT. One by one the others took up the air until a <b><font color='blue'>full</font></b> choir of voices was singing. They would sing so for hours, melody after melody, glee after glee, till the last pale <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> died down on the horizon, till the first dark night clouds came forth and night fell.</p><hr>
<p> From the door of Byron's public-house to the gate of Clontarf Chapel, from the gate of Clontail Chapel to the door of Byron's public-house and then back again to the chapel and then back again to the public-house he had paced slowly at first, planting his steps scrupulously in the spaces of the patchwork of the footpath, then timing their <b><font color='red'>fall</font></b> to the <b><font color='red'>fall</font></b> of verses.A <b><font color='blue'>full</font></b> hour had passed since his father had gone in with Dan Crosby, the tutor, to find out for him something about the university. For a <b><font color='blue'>full</font></b> hour he had paced up and down, waiting: but he could wait no longer.</p><hr>
<p> He closed his eyes in the languor of sleep. His eyelids trembled as if they felt the vast cyclic movement of the earth and her watchers, trembled as if they felt the strange <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> of some new world. His soul was swooning into some new world, fantastic, dim, uncertain as under sea, traversed by cloudy shapes and beings.A world, a glimmer or a flower? Glimmering and trembling, trembling and unfolding, a breaking <b><font color='red'>light</font></b>, an opening flower, it spread in endless succession to itself, breaking in <b><font color='blue'>full</font></b> crimson and unfolding and fading to palest rose, leaf by leaf and wave of <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> by wave of <b><font color='red'>light</font></b>, flooding all the heavens with its soft flushes, every flush deeper than the other.</p><hr>
