<p> The dull <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> fell more <b><font color='red'>faintly</font></b> upon the page whereon another equation began to unfold itself slowly and to spread abroad its widening tail. It was his own soul going forth to experience, unfolding itself sin by sin, spreading abroad the bale-fire of its burning stars and folding back upon itself, fading slowly, quenching its own <b><font color='red'>lights</font></b> and fires. They were quenched: and the <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> darkness filled chaos.</p><hr>
<p> The blundering answer stirred the embers of his contempt of his fellows. Towards others he felt neither shame nor fear. On Sunday mornings as he passed the church door he glanced <b><font color='blue'>coldly</font></b> at the worshippers who stood bareheaded, four deep, outside the church, morally present at the mass which they could neither see nor hear. Their dull piety and the sickly smell of the cheap hair-oil with which they had anointed their heads repelled him from the altar they prayed at. He stooped to the evil of hypocrisy with others, sceptical of their innocence which he could cajole so <b><font color='red'>easily</font></b>.</p><hr>
<p> As he crossed the square, walking homeward, the <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> laughter of a girl reached his burning ear. The frail gay sound smote his heart more strongly than a trumpet blast, and, not daring to lift his eyes, he turned aside and gazed, as he walked, into the shadow of the tangled shrubs. Shame rose from his smitten heart and flooded his whole being. The image of Emma appeared before him, and under her eyes the flood of shame rushed forth anew from his heart. If she knew to what his mind had subjected her or how his brute-like lust had torn and trampled upon her innocence! Was that boyish love? Was that chivalry? Was that poetry? The sordid details of his orgies stank under his very nostrils. The soot-coated packet of pictures which he had hidden in the flue of the fireplace and in the presence of whose shameless or bashful wantonness he lay for hours sinning in thought and deed; his monstrous dreams, peopled by ape-like creatures and by harlots with gleaming jewel eyes; the foul long letters he had written in the joy of guilty confession and carried secretly for days and days only to throw them under cover of night among the grass in the corner of a field or beneath some hingeless door in some niche in the hedges where a girl might come upon them as she walked by and read them secretly. Mad! Mad! Was it possible he had done these things?A <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> sweat broke out upon his forehead as the foul memories condensed within his brain.</p><hr>
<p> He sprang from the bed, the reeking odour pouring down his throat, clogging and revolting his entrails. Air! The air of heaven! He stumbled towards the window, groaning and almost <b><font color='red'>fainting</font></b> with sickness. At the washstand a convulsion seized him within; and, clasping his <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b> forehead wildly, he vomited profusely in agony.</p><hr>
<p>A wasting breath of humiliation blew bleakly over his soul to think of how he had <b><font color='red'>fallen</font></b>, to feel that those souls were dearer to God than his. The wind blew over him and passed on to the myriads and myriads of other souls on whom God's favour shone now more and now less, stars now brighter and now dimmer sustained and failing. And the glimmering souls passed away, sustained and failing, merged in a moving breath. One soul was lost; a tiny soul: his. It flickered once and went out, forgotten, lost. The end: black, <b><font color='blue'>cold</font></b>, void waste.</p><hr>
