<p> Contrahit orator, variant in carmine vates. The crises and victories and secessions in Roman history were handed on to him in the trite words IN TANTO DISCRIMINE and he had tried to peer into the social life of the city of cities through the words IMPLERE OLLAM DENARIORUM which the rector had rendered sonorously as the filling of a pot with denaries. The pages of his time-worn Horace never felt <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> to the touch even when his own fingers were <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b>; they were human pages and fifty years before they had been turned by the human fingers of John Duncan Inverarity and by his brother, William Malcolm Inverarity. Yes, those were noble names on the dusky flyleaf and, even for so poor a Latinist as he, the dusky verses were as fragrant as though they had lain all those years in myrtle and lavender and vervain; but yet it wounded him to think that he would never be but a shy guest at the feast of the world's culture and that the monkish learning, in terms of which he was striving to forge out an esthetic philosophy, was held no higher by the age he lived in than the subtle and curious jargons of heraldry and falconry.</p><hr>
<p> One night the young peasant, his spirit stung by the violent or luxurious language in which Stephen escaped from the <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> silence of intellectual revolt, had called up before Stephen's mind a strange vision. The two were walking slowly towards Davin's rooms through the dark narrow streets of the poorer jews.</p><hr>
<p>â €” The question you asked me a moment ago seems to me more interesting. What is that beauty which the artist struggles to express from lumps of earth, said Stephen <b><font color='red'>coldly</font></b>.</p><hr>
<p> Stephen looked <b><font color='red'>coldly</font></b> on the oblong skull beneath him overgrown with tangled twine-coloured hair. The voice, the accent, the mind of the questioner offended him and he allowed the offence to carry him towards wilful unkindness, bidding his mind think that the student's father would have done better had he sent his son to Belfast to study and have saved something on the train fare by so doing.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Do you know what Ireland is? asked Stephen with <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> violence. Ireland is the old sow that eats her farrow.</p><hr>
<p>â €”I am not speaking of that, Cranly said in a <b><font color='red'>colder</font></b> tone.I ask you if you ever felt love towards anyone or anything?</p><hr>
<p> His words seemed to have struck some deep chord in his own nature. Had he spoken of himself, of himself as he was or wished to be? Stephen watched his face for some moments in silence.A <b><font color='red'>cold</font></b> sadness was there. He had spoken of himself, of his own loneliness which he feared.</p><hr>
