<p> The lane behind the terrace was waterlogged and as he went down it slowly, choosing his steps amid heaps of <b><font color='red'>wet</font></b> rubbish, he heard a mad nun screeching in the nuns'madhouse beyond the wall.</p><hr>
<p> He shook the sound out of his ears by an angry toss of his head and hurried on, stumbling through the mouldering offal, his heart already bitten by an ache of loathing and bitterness. His father's whistle, his mother's mutterings, the screech of an unseen maniac were to him now so many voices offending and threatening to humble the pride of his youth. He drove their echoes even out of his heart with an execration; but, as he walked down the avenue and felt the grey morning light falling about him through the dripping trees and smelt the strange wild smell of the <b><font color='red'>wet</font></b> leaves and bark, his soul was loosed of her miseries.</p><hr>
<p> The rain-laden trees of the avenue evoked in him, as always, memories of the girls and women in the plays of Gerhart Hauptmann; and the memory of their pale sorrows and the fragrance falling from the <b><font color='red'>wet</font></b> branches mingled in a mood of quiet joy. His morning walk across the city had begun, and he foreknew that as he passed the sloblands of Fairview he would think of the cloistral silver-veined prose of Newman; that as he walked along the North Strand Road, glancing idly at the windows of the provision shops, he would recall the dark humour of Guido Cavalcanti and smile; that as he went by Baird's stonecutting works in Talbot Place the spirit of Ibsen would blow through him like a keen wind, a spirit of wayward boyish beauty; and that passing a grimy marine dealer's shop beyond the Liffey he would repeat the song by Ben Jonson which begins:</p><hr>
<p>â €” He has the face of a <b><font color='red'>besotted</font></b> Christ.</p><hr>
<p> His smiling eyes were fixed on a silver-wrapped tablet of milk chocolate which peeped out of the propagandist's breast-pocket.A little ring of listeners closed round to hear the war of wits.A lean student with olive skin and lank black hair thrust his face between the two, glancing from one to the other at each phrase and seeming to try to catch each flying phrase in his open <b><font color='red'>moist</font></b> mouth. Cranly took a small grey handball from his pocket and began to examine it closely, turning it over and over.</p><hr>
<p> They crossed the weedy garden together. The president, wrapped in a heavy loose cloak, was coming towards them along one of the walks, reading his office. At the end of the walk he halted before turning and raised his eyes. The students saluted, Temple fumbling as before at the peak of his cap. They walked forward in silence. As they neared the alley Stephen could hear the thuds of the players'hands and the <b><font color='red'>wet</font></b> smacks of the ball and Davin's voice crying out excitedly at each stroke.</p><hr>
<p> They had reached the canal bridge and, turning from their course, went on by the trees.A crude grey light, mirrored in the sluggish water and a smell of <b><font color='red'>wet</font></b> branches over their heads seemed to war against the course of Stephen's thought.</p><hr>
<p> Towards dawn he awoke.O what sweet music! His soul was all dewy <b><font color='red'>wet</font></b>. Over his limbs in sleep pale cool waves of light had passed. He lay still, as if his soul lay amid cool waters, conscious of faint sweet music. His mind was waking slowly to a tremulous morning knowledge, a morning inspiration.A spirit filled him, pure as the purest water, sweet as dew, moving as music. But how faintly it was inbreathed, how passionlessly, as if the seraphim themselves were breathing upon him! His soul was waking slowly, fearing to awake wholly. It was that windless hour of dawn when madness wakes and strange plants open to the light and the moth flies forth silently.</p><hr>
<p> Sadder to Stephen's ear was his speech: a genteel accent, low and <b><font color='red'>moist</font></b>, marred by errors, and, listening to it, he wondered was the story true and was the thin blood that flowed in his shrunken frame noble and come of an incestuous love?</p><hr>
<p> The park trees were heavy with rain; and rain fell still and ever in the lake, lying grey like a shield.A game of swans flew there and the water and the shore beneath were fouled with their green-white slime. They embraced softly, impelled by the grey rainy light, the <b><font color='red'>wet</font></b> silent trees, the shield-like witnessing lake, the swans. They embraced without joy or passion, his arm about his sister's neck.A grey woollen cloak was wrapped athwart her from her shoulder to her waist and her fair head was bent in willing shame. He had loose red-brown hair and tender shapely strong freckled hands. Face? There was no face seen. The brother's face was bent upon her fair rain-fragrant hair. The hand freckled and strong and shapely and caressing was Davin's hand.</p><hr>
