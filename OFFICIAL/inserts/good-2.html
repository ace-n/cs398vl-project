<p>â €” Very <b><font color='red'>good</font></b>, Simon. All serene, Simon, said the old man tranquilly. Anywhere you like. The outhouse will do me nicely: it will be more salubrious.</p><hr>
<p> During the first part of the summer in Blackrock uncle Charles was Stephen's constant companion. Uncle Charles was a hale old man with a <b><font color='red'>well</font></b> tanned skin, rugged features and white side whiskers. On week days he did messages between the house in Carysfort Avenue and those shops in the main street of the town with which the family dealt. Stephen was glad to go with him on these errands for uncle Charles helped him very liberally to handfuls of whatever was exposed in open boxes and barrels outside the counter. He would seize a handful of grapes and sawdust or three or four American apples and thrust them generously into his grandnephew's hand while the shopman smiled uneasily; and, on Stephen's feigning reluctance to take them, he would frown and say:</p><hr>
<p>â €” Take them, sir. Do you hear me, sir? They're <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> for your bowels.</p><hr>
<p> When the order list had been booked the two would go on to the park where an old friend of Stephen's father, Mike Flynn, would be found seated on a bench, waiting for them. Then would begin Stephen's run round the park. Mike Flynn would stand at the gate near the railway station, watch in hand, while Stephen ran round the track in the style Mike Flynn favoured, his head high lifted, his knees <b><font color='red'>well</font></b> lifted and his hands held straight down by his sides. When the morning practice was over the trainer would make his comments and sometimes illustrate them by shuffling along for a yard or so comically in an old pair of blue canvas shoes.A small ring of wonderstruck children and nursemaids would gather to watch him and linger even when he and uncle Charles had sat down again and were talking athletics and politics. Though he had heard his father say that Mike Flynn had put some of the best runners of modern times through his hands Stephen often glanced at his trainer's flabby stubble-covered face, as it bent over the long stained fingers through which he rolled his cigarette, and with pity at the mild lustreless blue eyes which would look up suddenly from the task and gaze vaguely into the blue distance while the long swollen fingers ceased their rolling and grains and fibres of tobacco fell back into the pouch.</p><hr>
<p> The coming of September did not trouble him this year for he was not to be sent back to Clongowes. The practice in the park came to an end when Mike Flynn went into hospital. Aubrey was at school and had only an hour or two free in the evening. The gang fell asunder and there were no more nightly forays or battles on the rocks. Stephen sometimes went round with the car which delivered the evening milk and these chilly drives blew away his memory of the filth of the cowyard and he felt no repugnance at seeing the cow hairs and hayseeds on the milkman's coat. Whenever the car drew up before a house he waited to catch a glimpse of a <b><font color='red'>well</font></b> scrubbed kitchen or of a softly lighted hall and to see how the servant would hold the jug and how she would close the door. He thought it should be a pleasant life enough, driving along the roads every evening to deliver milk, if he had warm gloves and a fat bag of gingernuts in his pocket to eat from. But the same foreknowledge which had sickened his heart and made his legs sag suddenly as he raced round the park, the same intuition which had made him glance with mistrust at his trainer's flabby stubble-covered face as it bent heavily over his long stained fingers, dissipated any vision of the future. In a vague way he understood that his father was in trouble and that this was the reason why he himself had not been sent back to Clongowes. For some time he had felt the slight change in his house; and those changes in what he had deemed unchangeable were so many slight shocks to his boyish conception of the world. The ambition which he felt astir at times in the darkness of his soul sought no outlet.A dusk like that of the outer world obscured his mind as he heard the mare's hoofs clattering along the tramtrack on the Rock Road and the great can swaying and rattling behind him.</p><hr>
<p>â €”O ...O, <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> evening, Stephen.</p><hr>
<p> But his long spell of leisure and liberty was drawing to its end. One evening his father came home <b><font color='red'>full</font></b> of news which kept his tongue busy all through dinner. Stephen had been awaiting his father's return for there had been mutton hash that day and he knew that his father would make him dip his bread in the gravy. But he did not relish the hash for the mention of Clongowes had coated his palate with a scum of disgust.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Rather. They live <b><font color='red'>well</font></b>,I tell you. You saw their table at Clongowes. Fed up, by God, like gamecocks.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Not he! said Mr Dedalus. But he gave me a great account of the whole affair. We were chatting, you know, and one word borrowed another. And, by the way, who do you think he told me will get that job in the corporation? ButI'll tell you that after. <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b>, asI was saying, we were chatting away quite friendly and he asked me did our friend here wear glasses still, and then he told me the whole story.</p><hr>
<p>â €”I was just telling my friend Wallis what a lark it would be tonight if you took off the rector in the part of the schoolmaster. It would be a ripping <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> joke.</p><hr>
<p> Stephen shook his head and smiled in his rival's flushed and mobile face, beaked like a bird's. He had often thought it strange that Vincent Heron had a bird's face as <b><font color='red'>well</font></b> as a bird's name.A shock of pale hair lay on the forehead like a ruffled crest: the forehead was narrow and bony and a thin hooked nose stood out between the close-set prominent eyes which were light and inexpressive. The rivals were school friends. They sat together in class, knelt together in the chapel, talked together after beads over their lunches. As the fellows in number one were undistinguished dullards, Stephen and Heron had been during the year the virtual heads of the school. It was they who went up to the rector together to ask for a free day or to get a fellow off.</p><hr>
<p>â €” So you may as <b><font color='red'>well</font></b> admit, Heron went on, that we've fairly found you out this time. You can't play the saint on me any more, that's one sure five.</p><hr>
<p> The stroke was playful but not so lightly given as the first one had been. Stephen felt the skin tingle and glow slightly and almost painlessly; and, bowing submissively, as if to meet his companion's jesting mood, began to recite the CONFITEOR. The episode ended <b><font color='red'>well</font></b>, for both Heron and Wallis laughed indulgently at the irreverence.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Admit that Byron was no <b><font color='red'>good</font></b>.</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b>,I must go now, said Stephen, who cared little for such points of honour.</p><hr>
<p> This spirit of quarrelsome comradeship which he had observed lately in his rival had not seduced Stephen from his habits of quiet obedience. He mistrusted the turbulence and doubted the sincerity of such comradeship which seemed to him a sorry anticipation of manhood. The question of honour here raised was, like all such questions, trivial to him. While his mind had been pursuing its intangible phantoms and turning in irresolution from such pursuit he had heard about him the constant voices of his father and of his masters, urging him to be a gentleman above all things and urging him to be a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> catholic above all things. These voices had now come to be hollow-sounding in his ears. When the gymnasium had been opened he had heard another voice urging him to be strong and manly and healthy and when the movement towards national revival had begun to be felt in the college yet another voice had bidden him be true to his country and help to raise up her language and tradition. In the profane world, as he foresaw, a worldly voice would bid him raise up his father's fallen state by his labours and, meanwhile, the voice of his school comrades urged him to be a decent fellow, to shield others from blame or to beg them off and to do his best to get free days for the school. And it was the din of all these hollow-sounding voices that made him halt irresolutely in the pursuit of phantoms. He gave them ear only for a time but he was happy only when he was far from them, beyond their call, alone or in the company of phantasmal comrades.</p><hr>
<p> In the vestry a plump fresh-faced jesuit and an elderly man, in shabby blue clothes, were dabbling in a case of paints and chalks. The boys who had been painted walked about or stood still awkwardly, touching their faces in a gingerly fashion with their furtive fingertips. In the middle of the vestry a young jesuit, who was then on a visit to the college, stood rocking himself rhythmically from the tips of his toes to his heels and back again, his hands thrust <b><font color='red'>well</font></b> forward into his side-pockets. His small head set off with glossy red curls and his newly shaven face agreed <b><font color='red'>well</font></b> with the spotless decency of his soutane and with his spotless shoes.</p><hr>
<p> As he watched this swaying form and tried to read for himself the legend of the priest's mocking smile there came into Stephen's memory a saying which he had heard from his father before he had been sent to Clongowes, that you could always tell a jesuit by the style of his clothes. At the same moment he thought he saw a likeness between his father's mind and that of this smiling <b><font color='red'>well</font></b>-dressed priest: and he was aware of some desecration of the priest's office or of the vestry itself whose silence was now routed by loud talk and joking and its air pungent with the smells of the gas-jets and the grease.</p><hr>
<p> That is horse piss and rotted straw, he thought. It is a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> odour to breathe. It will calm my heart. My heart is quite calm now.I will go back.</p><hr>
<p>'Tis youth and folly Makes young men marry, So here, my love,I'll No longer stay. What can't be cured, sure, Must be injured, sure, SoI'll go to Amerikay. My love she's handsome, My love she's bony: She's like <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> whisky When it is new; But when'tis old And growing cold It fades and dies like The mountain dew.</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b>,I hope they haven't moved the Queen's College anyhow, said Mr Dedalus, forI want to show it to this youngster of mine.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Ay, bedad! And there's the Groceries sure enough! cried Mr Dedalus. You often heard me speak of the Groceries, didn't you, Stephen. Many's the time we went down there when our names had been marked, a crowd of us, Harry Peard and little Jack Mountain and Bob Dyas and Maurice Moriarty, the Frenchman, and TomO'Grady and Mick Lacy thatI told you of this morning and Joey Corbet and poor little <b><font color='red'>good</font></b>-hearted Johnny Keevers of the Tantiles.</p><hr>
<p>â €” When you kick out for yourself, Stephenâ €” asI daresay you will one of these daysâ €” remember, whatever you do, to mix with gentlemen. WhenI was a young fellowI tell youI enjoyed myself.I mixed with fine decent fellows. Everyone of us could do something. One fellow had a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> voice, another fellow was a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> actor, another could sing a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> comic song, another was a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> oarsman or a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> racket player, another could tell a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> story and so on. We kept the ball rolling anyhow and enjoyed ourselves and saw a bit of life and we were none the worse of it either. But we were all gentlemen, Stephenâ €” at leastI hope we wereâ €” and bloody <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> honest Irishmen too. That's the kind of fellowsI want you to associate with, fellows of the right kidney.I'm talking to you as a friend, Stephen.I don't believe a son should be afraid of his father. No,I treat you as your grandfather treated me whenI was a young chap. We were more like brothers than father and son.I'll never forget the first day he caught me smoking.I was standing at the end of the South Terrace one day with some maneens like myself and sure we thought we were grand fellows because we had pipes stuck in the corners of our mouths. Suddenly the governor passed. He didn't say a word, or stop even. But the next day, Sunday, we were out for a walk together and when we were coming home he took out his cigar case and said:â €” By the by, Simon,I didn't know you smoked, or something like that.â €” Of courseI tried to carry it off as bestI could.â €” If you want a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> smoke, he said, try one of these cigars. An American captain made me a present of them last night in Queenstown.</p><hr>
<p>â €” BedadI am, said the little old man.I have two bouncing grandchildren out at Sunday's <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b>. Now, then! What age do you thinkI am? AndI remember seeing your grandfather in his red coat riding out to hounds. That was before you were born.</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b>,I'll tell you the truth, said the little old man.I'm just twenty-seven years of age.</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b>,I hope he'll be as <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> a man as his father. That's allI can say, said Mr Dedalus.</p><hr>
<p>â €” But did so much <b><font color='red'>good</font></b>, Simon, said the little old man gravely. Thanks be to God we lived so long and did so much <b><font color='red'>good</font></b>.</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b> that's done, said Mr Dedalus.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Dinner? said Mr Dedalus. <b><font color='red'>Well</font></b>,I suppose we had better, what?</p><hr>
<p>â €” Some place that's not too <b><font color='red'>dear</font></b>, said Mrs Dedalus.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Come along, said Stephen quickly. It doesn't matter about the <b><font color='red'>dearness</font></b>.</p><hr>
<p>â €” Take it easy like a <b><font color='red'>good</font></b> young fellow, said his father. We're not out for the half mile, are we?</p><hr>
<p>â €” <b><font color='red'>Good</font></b> night, Willie <b><font color='red'>dear</font></b>!</p><hr>
