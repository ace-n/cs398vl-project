<p> He crept about from point to point on the fringe of his line, making little runs now and then. But his hands were <b><font color='red'>bluish</font></b> with cold. He kept his hands in the side pockets of his belted grey suit. That was a belt round his pocket. And belt was also to give a fellow a belt. One day a fellow said to Cantwell:</p><hr>
<p> Stephen tried his best, but the sum was too hard and he felt confused. The little silk badge with the white rose on it that was pinned on the breast of his jacket began to flutter. He was no good at sums, but he tried his best so that York might not lose. Father Arnall's face looked very <b><font color='red'>black</font></b>, but he was not in a wax: he was laughing. Then Jack Lawton cracked his fingers and Father Arnall looked at his copybook and said:</p><hr>
<p> Jack Lawton looked over from his side. The little silk badge with the red rose on it looked very rich because he had a <b><font color='red'>blue</font></b> sailor top on. Stephen felt his own face red too, thinking of all the bets about who would get first place in elements, Jack Lawton or he. Some weeks Jack Lawton got the card for first and some weeks he got the card for first. His white silk badge fluttered and fluttered as he worked at the next sum and heard Father Arnall's voice. Then all his eagerness passed away and he felt his face quite cool. He thought his face must be white because it felt so cool. He could not get out the answer for the sum but it did not matter. White roses and red roses: those were beautiful colours to think of. And the cards for first place and second place and third place were beautiful colours too: pink and cream and lavender. Lavender and cream and pink roses were beautiful to think of. Perhaps a wild rose might be like those colours and he remembered the song about the wild rose blossoms on the little green place. But you could not have a green rose. But perhaps somewhere in the world you could.</p><hr>
<p> But he was not sick there. He thought that he was sick in his heart if you could be sick in that place. Fleming was very decent to ask him. He wanted to cry. He leaned his elbows on the table and shut and opened the flaps of his ears. Then he heard the noise of the refectory every time he opened the flaps of his ears. It made a roar like a train at <b><font color='red'>night</font></b>. And when he closed the flaps the roar was shut off like a train going into a tunnel. That <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> at Dalkey the train had roared like that and then, when it went into the tunnel, the roar stopped. He closed his eyes and the train went on, roaring and then stopping; roaring again, stopping. It was nice to hear it roar and stop and then roar out of the tunnel again and then stop.</p><hr>
<p>â €”O,I say, here's a fellow says he kisses his mother every <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> before he goes to bed.</p><hr>
<p> The cold slime of the ditch covered his whole body; and, when the bell rang for study and the lines filed out of the playrooms, he felt the cold air of the corridor and staircase inside his clothes. He still tried to think what was the right answer. Was it right to kiss his mother or wrong to kiss his mother? What did that mean, to kiss? You put your face up like that to say good <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> and then his mother put her face down. That was to kiss. His mother put her lips on his cheek; her lips were soft and they wetted his cheek; and they made a tiny little noise: kiss. Why did people do that with their two faces?</p><hr>
<p> There was a picture of the earth on the first page of his geography: a big ball in the middle of clouds. Fleming had a box of crayons and one <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> during free study he had coloured the earth green and the clouds maroon. That was like the two brushes in Dante's press, the brush with the green velvet back for Parnell and the brush with the maroon velvet back for Michael Davitt. But he had not told Fleming to colour them those colours. Fleming had done it himself.</p><hr>
<p> That was in his writing: and Fleming one <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> for a cod had written on the opposite page:</p><hr>
<p> It pained him that he did not know well what politics meant and that he did not know where the universe ended. He felt small and weak. When would he be like the fellows in poetry and rhetoric? They had big voices and big boots and they studied trigonometry. That was very far away. First came the vacation and then the next term and then vacation again and then again another term and then again the vacation. It was like a train going in and out of tunnels and that was like the noise of the boys eating in the refectory when you opened and closed the flaps of the ears. Term, vacation; tunnel, out; noise, stop. How far away it was! It was better to go to bed to sleep. Only prayers in the chapel and then bed. He shivered and yawned. It would be lovely in bed after the sheets got a bit hot. First they were so cold to get into. He shivered to think how cold they were first. But then they got hot and then he could sleep. It was lovely to be tired. He yawned again. <b><font color='red'>Night</font></b> prayers and then bed: he shivered and wanted to yawn. It would be lovely in a few minutes. He felt a warm glow creeping up from the cold shivering sheets, warmer and warmer till he felt warm all over, ever so warm and yet he shivered a little and still wanted to yawn.</p><hr>
<p> The bell rang for <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> prayers and he filed out of the study hall after the others and down the staircase and along the corridors to the chapel. The corridors were <b><font color='red'>darkly</font></b> lit and the chapel was <b><font color='red'>darkly</font></b> lit. Soon all would be <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> and sleeping. There was cold <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> air in the chapel and the marbles were the colour the sea was at <b><font color='red'>night</font></b>. The sea was cold day and <b><font color='red'>night</font></b>: but it was colder at <b><font color='red'>night</font></b>. It was cold and <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> under the seawall beside his father's house. But the kettle would be on the hob to make punch.</p><hr>
<p> There was a cold <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> smell in the chapel. But it was a holy smell. It was not like the smell of the old peasants who knelt at the back of the chapel at Sunday mass. That was a smell of air and rain and turf and corduroy. But they were very holy peasants. They breathed behind him on his neck and sighed as they prayed. They lived in Clane, a fellow said: there were little cottages there and he had seen a woman standing at the half-door of a cottage with a child in her arms as the cars had come past from Sallins. It would be lovely to sleep for one <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> in that cottage before the fire of smoking turf, in the <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> lit by the fire, in the warm <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b>, breathing the smell of the peasants, air and rain and turf and corduroy. ButO, the road there between the trees was <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b>! You would be lost in the <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b>. It made him afraid to think of how it was.</p><hr>
<p> He heard the voice of the prefect of the chapel saying the last prayers. He prayed it too against the <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> outside under the trees.</p><hr>
<p> He blessed himself and climbed quickly into bed and, tucking the end of the nightshirt under his feet, curled himself together under the cold white sheets, shaking and trembling. But he would not go to hell when he died; and the shaking would stop.A voice bade the boys in the dormitory good <b><font color='red'>night</font></b>. He peered out for an instant over the coverlet and saw the yellow curtains round and before his bed that shut him off on all sides. The light was lowered quietly.</p><hr>
<p> The prefect's shoes went away. Where? Down the staircase and along the corridors or to his room at the end? He saw the <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b>. Was it true about the <b><font color='red'>black</font></b> dog that walked there at <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> with eyes as big as carriage-lamps? They said it was the ghost of a murderer.A long shiver of fear flowed over his body. He saw the <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> entrance hall of the castle. Old servants in old dress were in the ironing-room above the staircase. It was long ago. The old servants were quiet. There was a fire there, but the hall was still <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b>.A figure came up the staircase from the hall. He wore the white cloak of a marshal; his face was pale and strange; he held his hand pressed to his side. He looked out of strange eyes at the old servants. They looked at him and saw their master's face and cloak and knew that he had received his death-wound. But only the <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> was where they looked: only <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> silent air. Their master had received his death-wound on the battlefield of Prague far away over the sea. He was standing on the field; his hand was pressed to his side; his face was pale and strange and he wore the white cloak of a marshal.</p><hr>
<p>O how cold and strange it was to think of that! All the <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> was cold and strange. There were pale strange faces there, great eyes like carriage-lamps. They were the ghosts of murderers, the figures of marshals who had received their death-wound on battlefields far away over the sea. What did they wish to say that their faces were so strange?</p><hr>
<p> The train was full of fellows: a long long chocolate train with cream facings. The guards went to and fro opening, closing, locking, unlocking the doors. They were men in <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> <b><font color='red'>blue</font></b> and silver; they had silvery whistles and their keys made a quick music: click, click: click, click.</p><hr>
<p> It was not Wells's face, it was the prefect's. He was not foxing. No, no: he was sick really. He was not foxing. And he felt the prefect's hand on his forehead; and he felt his forehead warm and damp against the prefect's cold damp hand. That was the way a rat felt, slimy and damp and cold. Every rat had two eyes to look out of. Sleek slimy coats, little little feet tucked up to jump, <b><font color='red'>black</font></b> slimy eyes to look out of. They could understand how to jump. But the minds of rats could not understand trigonometry. When they were dead they lay on their sides. Their coats dried then. They were only dead things.</p><hr>
<p> Brother Michael was standing at the door of the infirmary and from the door of the <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> cabinet on his right came a smell like medicine. That came from the bottles on the shelves. The prefect spoke to Brother Michael and Brother Michael answered and called the prefect sir. He had reddish hair mixed with grey and a queer look. It was queer that he would always be a brother. It was queer too that you could not call him sir because he was a brother and had a different kind of look. Was he not holy enough or why could he not catch up on the others?</p><hr>
<p> How far away they were! There was cold sunlight outside the window. He wondered if he would die. You could die just the same on a sunny day. He might die before his mother came. Then he would have a dead mass in the chapel like the way the fellows had told him it was when Little had died. All the fellows would be at the mass, dressed in <b><font color='red'>black</font></b>, all with sad faces. Wells too would be there but no fellow would look at him. The rector would be there in a cope of <b><font color='red'>black</font></b> and gold and there would be tall yellow candles on the altar and round the catafalque. And they would carry the coffin out of the chapel slowly and he would be buried in the little graveyard of the community off the main avenue of limes. And Wells would be sorry then for what he had done. And the bell would toll slowly.</p><hr>
<p> Dingdong! The castle bell! Farewell, my mother! Bury me in the old churchyard Beside my eldest brother. My coffin shall be <b><font color='red'>black</font></b>, Six angels at my back, Two to sing and two to pray And two to carry my soul away.</p><hr>
<p> Why did he not tell it? His father, who kept the racehorses, must be a magistrate too like Saurin's father and Nasty Roche's father. He thought of his own father, of how he sang songs while his mother played and of how he always gave him a shilling when he asked for sixpence and he felt sorry for him that he was not a magistrate like the other boys'fathers. Then why was he sent to that place with them? But his father had told him that he would be no stranger there because his granduncle had presented an address to the liberator there fifty years before. You could know the people of that time by their old dress. It seemed to him a solemn time: and he wondered if that was the time when the fellows in Clongowes wore <b><font color='red'>blue</font></b> coats with brass buttons and yellow waistcoats and caps of rabbitskin and drank beer like grown-up people and kept greyhounds of their own to course the hares with.</p><hr>
<p> He saw the sea of waves, long <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> waves rising and falling, <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> under the moonless <b><font color='red'>night</font></b>.A tiny light twinkled at the pierhead where the ship was entering: and he saw a multitude of people gathered by the waters'edge to see the ship that was entering their harbour.A tall man stood on the deck, looking out towards the flat <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> land: and by the light at the pierhead he saw his face, the sorrowful face of Brother Michael.</p><hr>
<p> Why did Mr Barrett in Clongowes call his pandybat a turkey? But Clongowes was far away: and the warm heavy smell of turkey and ham and celery rose from the plates and dishes and the great fire was banked high and red in the grate and the green ivy and red holly made you feel so happy and when dinner was ended the big plum pudding would be carried in, studded with peeled almonds and sprigs of holly, with <b><font color='red'>bluish</font></b> fire running around it and a little green flag flying from the top.</p><hr>
<p>â €” We are all sinners and <b><font color='red'>black</font></b> sinners, said Mr Casey coldly.</p><hr>
<p> Stephen looked with affection at Mr Casey's face which stared across the table over his joined hands. He liked to sit near him at the fire, looking up at his <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> fierce face. But his <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> eyes were never fierce and his slow voice was good to listen to. But why was he then against the priests? Because Dante must be right then. But he had heard his father say that she was a spoiled nun and that she had come out of the convent in the Alleghanies when her brother had got the money from the savages for the trinkets and the chainies. Perhaps that made her severe against Parnell. And she did not like him to play with Eileen because Eileen was a protestant and when she was young she knew children that used to play with protestants and the protestants used to make fun of the litany of the Blessed Virgin. TOWER OF IVORY, they used to say, HOUSE OF GOLD! How could a woman be a tower of ivory or a house of gold? Who was right then? And he remembered the evening in the infirmary in Clongowes, the <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> waters, the light at the pierhead and the moan of sorrow from the people when they had heard.</p><hr>
<p> But what was the name the woman had called KittyO'Shea that Mr Casey would not repeat? He thought of Mr Casey walking through the crowds of people and making speeches from a wagonette. That was what he had been in prison for and he remembered that one <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> SergeantO'Neill had come to the house and had stood in the hall, talking in a low voice with his father and chewing nervously at the chinstrap of his cap. And that <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> Mr Casey had not gone to Dublin by train but a car had come to the door and he had heard his father say something about the Cabinteely road.</p><hr>
<p> He was for Ireland and Parnell and so was his father: and so was Dante too for one <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> at the band on the esplanade she had hit a gentleman on the head with her umbrella because he had taken off his hat when the band played GOD SAVE THE QUEEN at the end.</p><hr>
<p> Uncle Charles and Mr Dedalus pulled Mr Casey back into his chair again, talking to him from both sides reasonably. He stared before him out of his <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> flaming eyes, repeating:</p><hr>
<p> The fellows all were silent. Stephen stood among them, afraid to speak, listening.A faint sickness of awe made him feel weak. How could they have done that? He thought of the <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> silent sacristy. There were <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> wooden presses there where the crimped surplices lay quietly folded. It was not the chapel but still you had to speak under your breath. It was a holy place. He remembered the summer evening he had been there to be dressed as boatbearer, the evening of the Procession to the little altar in the wood.A strange and holy place. The boy that held the censer had swung it lifted by the middle chain to keep the coals lighting. That was called charcoal: and it had burned quietly as the fellow had swung it gently and had given off a weak sour smell. And then when all were vested he had stood holding out the boat to the rector and the rector had put a spoonful of incense in it and it had hissed on the red coals.</p><hr>
<p>â €” They were caught with Simon Moonan and Tusker Boyle in the square one <b><font color='red'>night</font></b>.</p><hr>
<p> Stephen looked at the faces of the fellows but they were all looking across the playground. He wanted to ask somebody about it. What did that mean about the smugging in the square? Why did the five fellows out of the higher line run away for that? It was a joke, he thought. Simon Moonan had nice clothes and one <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> he had shown him a ball of creamy sweets that the fellows of the football fifteen had rolled down to him along the carpet in the middle of the refectory when he was at the door. It was the <b><font color='red'>night</font></b> of the match against the Bective Rangers; and the ball was made just like a red and green apple only it opened and it was full of the creamy sweets. And one day Boyle had said that an elephant had two tuskers instead of two tusks and that was why he was called Tusker Boyle but some fellows called him Lady Boyle because he was always at his nails, paring them.</p><hr>
<p> But Mr Harford was very decent and never got into a wax. All the other masters got into dreadful waxes. But why were they to suffer for what fellows in the higher line did? Wells had said that they had drunk some of the altar wine out of the press in the sacristy and that it had been found out who had done it by the smell. Perhaps they had stolen a monstrance to run away with and sell it somewhere. That must have been a terrible sin, to go in there quietly at <b><font color='red'>night</font></b>, to open the <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> press and steal the flashing gold thing into which God was put on the altar in the middle of flowers and candles at benediction while the incense went up in clouds at both sides as the fellow swung the censer and Dominic Kelly sang the first part by himself in the choir. But God was not in it of course when they stole it. But still it was a strange and a great sin even to touch it. He thought of it with deep awe; a terrible and strange sin: it thrilled him to think of it in the silence when the pens scraped lightly. But to drink the altar wine out of the press and be found out by the smell was a sin too: but it was not terrible and strange. It only made you feel a little sickish on account of the smell of the wine. Because on the day when he had made his first holy communion in the chapel he had shut his eyes and opened his mouth and put out his tongue a little: and when the rector had stooped down to give him the holy communion he had smelt a faint winy smell off the rector's breath after the wine of the mass. The word was beautiful: wine. It made you think of <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> purple because the grapes were <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> purple that grew in Greece outside houses like white temples. But the faint smell of the rector's breath had made him feel a sick feeling on the morning of his first communion. The day of your first communion was the happiest day of your life. And once a lot of generals had asked Napoleon what was the happiest day of his life. They thought he would say the day he won some great battle or the day he was made an emperor. But he said:</p><hr>
<p> Then he asked the next boy and the next and the next. Nobody knew. Father Arnall became very quiet, more and more quiet as each boy tried to answer it and could not. But his face was <b><font color='red'>black</font></b>-looking and his eyes were staring though his voice was so quiet. Then he asked Fleming and Fleming said that the word had no plural. Father Arnall suddenly shut the book and shouted at him:</p><hr>
<p> Fleming moved heavily out of his place and knelt between the two last benches. The other boys bent over their theme-books and began to write.A silence filled the classroom and Stephen, glancing timidly at Father Arnall's <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> face, saw that it was a little red from the wax he was in.</p><hr>
<p> He could not eat the <b><font color='red'>blackish</font></b> fish fritters they got on Wednesdays in lent and one of his potatoes had the mark of the spade in it. Yes, he would do what the fellows had told him. He would go up and tell the rector that he had been wrongly punished.A thing like that had been done before by somebody in history, by some great person whose head was in the books of history. And the rector would declare that he had been wrongly punished because the senate and the Roman people always declared that the men who did that had been wrongly punished. Those were the great men whose names were in Richmal Magnall's Questions. History was all about those men and what they did and that was what Peter Parley's Tales about Greece and Rome were all about. Peter Parley himself was on the first page in a picture. There was a road over a heath with grass at the side and little bushes: and Peter Parley had a broad hat like a protestant minister and a big stick and he was walking fast along the road to Greece and Rome.</p><hr>
<p> It was easy what he had to do. All he had to do was when the dinner was over and he came out in his turn to go on walking but not out to the corridor but up the staircase on the right that led to the castle. He had nothing to do but that: to turn to the right and walk fast up the staircase and in half a minute he would be in the low <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> narrow corridor that led through the castle to the rector's room. And every fellow had said that it was unfair, even the fellow out of second of grammar who had said that about the senate and the Roman people.</p><hr>
<p> He heard the fellows of the higher line stand up at the top of the refectory and heard their steps as they came down the matting: Paddy Rath and Jimmy Magee and the Spaniard and the Portuguese and the fifth was big Corrigan who was going to be flogged by Mr Gleeson. That was why the prefect of studies had called him a schemer and pandied him for nothing: and, straining his weak eyes, tired with the tears, he watched big Corrigan's broad shoulders and big hanging <b><font color='red'>black</font></b> head passing in the file. But he had done something and besides Mr Gleeson would not flog him hard: and he remembered how big Corrigan looked in the bath. He had skin the same colour as the turf-coloured bogwater in the shallow end of the bath and when he walked along the side his feet slapped loudly on the wet tiles and at every step his thighs shook a little because he was fat.</p><hr>
<p> He had reached the door and, turning quickly up to the right, walked up the stairs and, before he could make up his mind to come back, he had entered the low <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> narrow corridor that led to the castle. And as he crossed the threshold of the door of the corridor he saw, without turning his head to look, that all the fellows were looking after him as they went filing by.</p><hr>
<p> He passed along the narrow <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> corridor, passing little doors that were the doors of the rooms of the community. He peered in front of him and right and left through the gloom and thought that those must be portraits. It was <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> and silent and his eyes were weak and tired with tears so that he could not see. But he thought they were the portraits of the saints and great men of the order who were looking down on him silently as he passed: saint Ignatius Loyola holding an open book and pointing to the words AD MAJOREM DEI GLORIAM in it; saint Francis Xavier pointing to his chest; Lorenzo Ricci with his berretta on his head like one of the prefects of the lines, the three patrons of holy youthâ €” saint Stanislaus Kostka, saint Aloysius Gonzago, and Blessed John Berchmans, all with young faces because they died when they were young, and Father Peter Kenny sitting in a chair wrapped in a big cloak.</p><hr>
<p> But when he had passed the old servant on the landing and was again in the low narrow <b><font color='red'>dark</font></b> corridor he began to walk faster and faster. Faster and faster he hurried on through the gloom excitedly. He bumped his elbow against the door at the end and, hurrying down the staircase, walked quickly through the two corridors and out into the air.</p><hr>
