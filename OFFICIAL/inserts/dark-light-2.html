<p> The coming of September did not trouble him this year for he was not to be sent back to Clongowes. The practice in the park came to an end when Mike Flynn went into hospital. Aubrey was at school and had only an hour or two free in the evening. The gang fell asunder and there were no more <b><font color='blue'>nightly</font></b> forays or battles on the rocks. Stephen sometimes went round with the car which delivered the evening milk and these chilly drives blew away his memory of the filth of the cowyard and he felt no repugnance at seeing the cow hairs and hayseeds on the milkman's coat. Whenever the car drew up before a house he waited to catch a glimpse of a well scrubbed kitchen or of a softly <b><font color='red'>lighted</font></b> hall and to see how the servant would hold the jug and how she would close the door. He thought it should be a pleasant life enough, driving along the roads every evening to deliver milk, if he had warm gloves and a fat bag of gingernuts in his pocket to eat from. But the same foreknowledge which had sickened his heart and made his legs sag suddenly as he raced round the park, the same intuition which had made him glance with mistrust at his trainer's flabby stubble-covered face as it bent heavily over his long stained fingers, dissipated any vision of the future. In a vague way he understood that his father was in trouble and that this was the reason why he himself had not been sent back to Clongowes. For some time he had felt the slight change in his house; and those changes in what he had deemed unchangeable were so many slight shocks to his boyish conception of the world. The ambition which he felt astir at times in the <b><font color='blue'>darkness</font></b> of his soul sought no outlet.A dusk like that of the outer world obscured his mind as he heard the mare's hoofs clattering along the tramtrack on the Rock Road and the great can swaying and rattling behind him.</p><hr>
<p> He returned to Mercedes and, as he brooded upon her image, a strange unrest crept into his blood. Sometimes a fever gathered within him and led him to rove alone in the evening along the quiet avenue. The peace of the gardens and the kindly <b><font color='red'>lights</font></b> in the windows poured a tender influence into his restless heart. The noise of children at play annoyed him and their silly voices made him feel, even more keenly than he had felt at Clongowes, that he was different from others. He did not want to play. He wanted to meet in the real world the unsubstantial image which his soul so constantly beheld. He did not know where to seek it or how, but a premonition which led him on told him that this image would, without any overt act of his, encounter him. They would meet quietly as if they had known each other and had made their tryst, perhaps at one of the gates or in some more secret place. They would be alone, surrounded by <b><font color='blue'>darkness</font></b> and silence: and in that moment of supreme tenderness he would be transfigured.</p><hr>
<p> It was the last tram. The lank brown horses knew it and shook their bells to the clear <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b> in admonition. The conductor talked with the driver, both nodding often in the green <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> of the lamp. On the empty seats of the tram were scattered a few coloured tickets. No sound of footsteps came up or down the road. No sound broke the peace of the <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b> save when the lank brown horses rubbed their noses together and shook their bells.</p><hr>
<p> At the far end of the shed near the street a speck of pink <b><font color='red'>light</font></b> showed in the <b><font color='blue'>darkness</font></b> and as he walked towards it he became aware of a <b><font color='red'>faint</font></b> aromatic odour. Two boys were standing in the shelter of a doorway, smoking, and before he reached them he had recognised Heron by his voice.</p><hr>
<p> While he was still repeating the CONFITEOR amid the indulgent laughter of his hearers and while the scenes of that malignant episode were still passing sharply and swiftly before his mind he wondered why he bore no malice now to those who had tormented him. He had not forgotten a whit of their cowardice and cruelty but the memory of it called forth no anger from him. All the descriptions of fierce love and hatred which he had met in books had seemed to him therefore unreal. Even that <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b> as he stumbled homewards along Jones's Road he had felt that some power was divesting him of that sudden-woven anger as <b><font color='red'>easily</font></b> as a fruit is divested of its soft ripe peel.</p><hr>
<p> He remained standing with his two companions at the end of the shed listening idly to their talk or to the bursts of applause in the theatre. She was sitting there among the others perhaps waiting for him to appear. He tried to recall her appearance but could not. He could remember only that she had worn a shawl about her head like a cowl and that her <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> eyes had invited and unnerved him. He wondered had he been in her thoughts as she had been in his. Then in the <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> and unseen by the other two he rested the tips of the fingers of one hand upon the palm of the other hand, scarcely touching it <b><font color='red'>lightly</font></b>. But the pressure of her fingers had been <b><font color='red'>lighter</font></b> and steadier: and suddenly the memory of their touch traversed his brain and body like an invisible wave.</p><hr>
<p> He left the stage quickly and rid himself of his mummery and passed out through the chapel into the college garden. Now that the play was over his nerves cried for some further adventure. He hurried onwards as if to overtake it. The doors of the theatre were all open and the audience had emptied out. On the lines which he had fancied the moorings of an ark a few lanterns swung in the <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b> breeze, flickering cheerlessly. He mounted the steps from the garden in haste, eager that some prey should not elude him, and forced his way through the crowd in the hall and past the two jesuits who stood watching the exodus and bowing and shaking hands with the visitors. He pushed onward nervously, feigning a still greater haste and <b><font color='red'>faintly</font></b> conscious of the smiles and stares and nudges which his powdered head left in its wake.</p><hr>
<p>A film still veiled his eyes but they burned no longer.A power, akin to that which had often made anger or resentment <b><font color='red'>fall</font></b> from him, brought his steps to rest. He stood still and gazed up at the sombre porch of the morgue and from that to the <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> cobbled laneway at its side. He saw the word LOTTS on the wall of the lane and breathed slowly the rank heavy air.</p><hr>
<p> He recalled his own equivocal position in Belvedere, a free boy, a leader afraid of his own authority, proud and sensitive and suspicious, battling against the squalor of his life and against the riot of his mind. The letters cut in the stained wood of the desk stared upon him, mocking his bodily weakness and futile enthusiasms and making him loathe himself for his own mad and filthy orgies. The spittle in his throat grew bitter and foul to swallow and the <b><font color='red'>faint</font></b> sickness climbed to his brain so that for a moment he closed his eyes and walked on in <b><font color='blue'>darkness</font></b>.</p><hr>
<p> He heard the sob passing loudly down his father's throat and opened his eyes with a nervous impulse. The sunlight breaking suddenly on his sight turned the sky and clouds into a fantastic world of sombre masses with lakelike spaces of <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> rosy <b><font color='red'>light</font></b>. His very brain was sick and powerless. He could scarcely interpret the letters of the signboards of the shops. By his monstrous way of life he seemed to have put himself beyond the limits of reality. Nothing moved him or spoke to him from the real world unless he heard in it an echo of the infuriated cries within him. He could respond to no earthly or human appeal, dumb and insensible to the call of summer and gladness and companionship, wearied and dejected by his father's voice. He could scarcely recognize as his own thoughts, and repeated slowly to himself:</p><hr>
<p> He turned to appease the fierce longings of his heart before which everything else was <b><font color='red'>idle</font></b> and alien. He cared little that he was in mortal sin, that his life had grown to be a tissue of subterfuge and falsehood. Beside the savage desire within him to realize the enormities which he brooded on nothing was sacred. He bore cynically with the shameful details of his secret riots in which he exulted to defile with patience whatever image had attracted his eyes. By day and by <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b> he moved among distorted images of the outer world.A figure that had seemed to him by day demure and innocent came towards him by <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b> through the winding <b><font color='blue'>darkness</font></b> of sleep, her face transfigured by a lecherous cunning, her eyes bright with brutish joy. Only the morning pained him with its dim memory of <b><font color='blue'>dark</font></b> orgiastic riot, its keen and humiliating sense of transgression.</p><hr>
