<p> The cold slime of the ditch covered his whole body; and, when the bell rang for study and the lines filed out of the playrooms, he felt the cold air of the corridor and staircase inside his clothes. He still tried to think what was the right answer. Was it right to kiss his mother or wrong to kiss his mother? What did that mean, to kiss? You put your face up like that to say good <b><font color='blue'>night</font></b> and then his mother put her face down. That was to kiss.

He had skin the same colour as the turf-coloured bogwater in the shallow end of the bath and when he walked along the side his feet slapped loudly on the <b><font color='red'>wet</font></b> tiles and at every step his thighs shook a little because he was fat.</p><hr>
