<p> He shook the sound out of his ears by an angry toss of his head and hurried on, stumbling through the mouldering offal, his heart already bitten by an ache of loathing and bitterness. His father's whistle, his mother's mutterings, the screech of an unseen maniac were to him now so many voices offending and threatening to humble the pride of his youth. He drove their echoes even out of his heart with an execration; but, as he walked down the avenue and felt the grey morning <b><font color='blue'>light</font></b> <b><font color='blue'>falling</font></b> about him through the dripping trees and smelt the strange wild smell of the <b><font color='red'>wet</font></b> leaves and bark, his soul was loosed of her miseries.</p><hr>
<p> The rain-laden trees of the avenue evoked in him, as always, memories of the girls and women in the plays of Gerhart Hauptmann; and the memory of their pale sorrows and the fragrance <b><font color='blue'>falling</font></b> from the <b><font color='red'>wet</font></b> branches mingled in a mood of quiet joy. His morning walk across the city had begun, and he foreknew that as he passed the sloblands of Fairview he would think of the cloistral silver-veined prose of Newman; that as he walked along the North Strand Road, glancing idly at the windows of the provision shops, he would recall the dark humour of Guido Cavalcanti and smile; that as he went by Baird's stonecutting works in Talbot Place the spirit of Ibsen would blow through him like a keen wind, a spirit of wayward boyish beauty; and that passing a grimy marine dealer's shop beyond the Liffey he would repeat the song by Ben Jonson which begins:</p><hr>
<p> They had reached the canal bridge and, turning from their course, went on by the trees.A crude grey <b><font color='blue'>light</font></b>, mirrored in the sluggish water and a smell of <b><font color='red'>wet</font></b> branches over their heads seemed to war against the course of Stephen's thought.</p><hr>
<p> Towards dawn he awoke.O what sweet music! His soul was all dewy <b><font color='red'>wet</font></b>. Over his limbs in sleep pale cool waves of <b><font color='blue'>light</font></b> had passed. He lay still, as if his soul lay amid cool waters, conscious of <b><font color='blue'>faint</font></b> sweet music. His mind was waking slowly to a tremulous morning knowledge, a morning inspiration.A spirit filled him, pure as the purest water, sweet as dew, moving as music. But how <b><font color='blue'>faintly</font></b> it was inbreathed, how passionlessly, as if the seraphim themselves were breathing upon him! His soul was waking slowly, fearing to awake wholly. It was that windless hour of dawn when madness wakes and strange plants open to the <b><font color='blue'>light</font></b> and the moth flies forth silently.</p><hr>
<p> The park trees were heavy with rain; and rain fell still and ever in the lake, lying grey like a shield.A game of swans flew there and the water and the shore beneath were fouled with their green-white slime. They embraced softly, impelled by the grey rainy <b><font color='blue'>light</font></b>, the <b><font color='red'>wet</font></b> silent trees, the shield-like witnessing lake, the swans. They embraced without joy or passion, his arm about his sister's neck.A grey woollen cloak was wrapped athwart her from her shoulder to her waist and her fair head was bent in willing shame. He had loose red-brown hair and tender shapely strong freckled hands. Face? There was no face seen. The brother's face was bent upon her fair rain-fragrant hair. The hand freckled and strong and shapely and caressing was Davin's hand.</p><hr>
